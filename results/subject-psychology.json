                "\nIndividuals with high levels of psychopathic traits tend to undervalue long-term, affiliative relationships, but it remains unclear what motivates them to engage in social interactions at all. Their experience of social reward may provide an important clue. In Study 1 of this paper, a large sample of participants (N = 505) completed a measure of psychopathic traits (Self-Report Psychopathy Scale Short-Form) and a measure of social reward value (Social Reward Questionnaire) to explore what aspects of social reward are associated with psychopathic traits. In Study 2 (N = 110), the same measures were administered to a new group of participants along with two experimental tasks investigating monetary and social reward value. Psychopathic traits were found to be positively correlated with the enjoyment of callous treatment of others and negatively associated with the enjoyment of positive social interactions. This indicates a pattern of ‘inverted’ social reward in which being cruel is enjoyable and being kind is not. Interpersonal psychopathic traits were also positively associated with the difference between mean reaction times (RTs) in the monetary and social experimental reward tasks; individuals with high levels of these traits responded comparatively faster to social than monetary reward. We speculate that this may be because social approval/admiration has particular value for these individuals, who have a tendency to use and manipulate others. Together, these studies provide evidence that the self-serving and cruel social behaviour seen in psychopathy may in part be explained by what these individuals find rewarding.\n"

            "fulltext": "IntroductionPsychopathy is a personality disorder characterised by lack of empathy, shallow affect and callous treatment of other people, as well as impulsivity and a greater propensity towards criminal behaviour [1]. Psychopathic traits are continuously distributed in the population and can be reliably measured in community samples [2]–[3].\nEmpirical evidence suggests that psychopathic traits may be associated with an atypical experience of social reward [4]–[9]. Social reward can be defined as the motivational and pleasurable aspects of our interactions with other people, and interpersonal kindness and closeness is a fundamental social reward for most people [10]–[11]. However, it appears that individuals with high levels of psychopathic traits do not place equal importance on affiliative, long-term friendships and relationships [4]. Instead they favour friends who can increase their access to sexual mates or provide protection [12] and prefer one-night stands to committed relationships [13]. In addition, evidence from experimental tasks shows that individuals with high levels of psychopathic traits are less likely to cooperate with and help others [5], [8]–[9] Together, this evidence suggests that, for individuals with high levels of psychopathic traits, affiliative and prosocial behaviour towards others may be less rewarding than it is for typical individuals [6].\nFurthermore, psychopathic traits are associated with enjoyment of antisocial entertainment such as violent sports and video games [14] and internet ‘trolling’ - online antisocial behaviour [15]. This evidence suggests individuals with high levels of psychopathic traits not only lack empathy towards others’ distress [16]–[17], but may actually take pleasure from it. Thus individuals with high levels of psychopathic traits appear to show an unusual pattern of social reward: decreased reward value of prosocial and affiliative interactions [4], [6]–[7], and increased reward value of cruelty towards others [14]–[15]. This suggestion is supported by a recent study that used a systematic measure of social reward, the Social Reward Questionnaire (SRQ; [7]). This preliminary analysis found that scores on the psychopathy subscale of the brief Dirty Dozen measure [18] were negatively associated with enjoyment of prosocial interactions and positively associated with enjoyment of callous, antisocial interactions [7]. However, this four-item measure of psychopathy is unidimensional, so it remains unclear how different aspects of psychopathic personality are associated with dimensions of social reward. As such, there remains a need to systematically explore associations between the value of different social rewards and a comprehensive, well-validated measure of psychopathic traits.\nThere is an equal need to employ experimental measures that can more sensitively assess the experience of social reward in relation to psychopathic traits. Such measures have the potential to overcome several of the limitations inherent in using self-report questionnaires, including the ability and/or willingness of participants to reflect on and state their personality traits. Some research has assessed responsiveness to monetary reward in relation to psychopathic traits, and found that individuals with high levels of these traits may be hyperresponsive to this type of reward [19]–[20]. Although the last decade has seen a surge in the number of studies using experimental paradigms to measure social reward (e.g. [21]–[23]), to our knowledge these paradigms have not yet been used in association with a measure of psychopathic traits.\nIn the current paper, we report two studies that explore the relationship between social reward and psychopathic traits. In the first study, we aimed to assess the association between subtypes of social reward and dimensions of psychopathic traits using questionnaire methodology. In the second study, our aim was to employ an experimental measure of social reward and investigate its association with psychopathic traits (Study 2).\nStudy 1In Study 1, our aim was to elucidate some of the processes that may motivate the unpleasant interpersonal behaviour associated with psychopathic traits. To do this, we explored associations between psychopathic traits, as measured by the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale Short-Form (SRP-SF; [24]), and the value of different types of social reward, as measured by the Social Reward Questionnaire (SRQ; [7]). The SRP-SF measures four dimensions of psychopathy: Affective (e.g. lack of empathy), Interpersonal (e.g. manipulativeness), Lifestyle (e.g. impulsivity) and Antisocial (e.g. aggressive or unlawful behaviour). The SRQ quantifies the enjoyment of six types of social reward: Admiration (being flattered and gaining attention), Negative Social Potency (being cruel and callous), Passivity (allowing others control), Prosocial Interactions (being kind and fair), Sexual Relationships (frequent sexual encounters) and Sociability (frequent socialising). We hypothesised that psychopathic traits would be positively associated with Negative Social Potency and negatively associated with Prosocial Interactions. In addition, we hypothesised that psychopathic traits would be positively associated with Sexual Relationships, due to the high rates of affairs and short-term relationships reported in this group [25]–[26]. Finally, we predicted that psychopathic traits would be positively associated with enjoyment of Admiration, due to the elevated levels of narcissism seen in individuals with high levels of psychopathic traits [27]. We made no specific hypotheses regarding which dimensions of psychopathy would show these associations. Associations between psychopathic traits and other types of social reward were exploratory.\n\nMaterials and Methods\nData for this study were collected as part of a wider battery of measures that have been partly reported in a previous publication [7].\nEthics Statement.All participants provided written informed consent and the study was approved by the University College London Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology Research Ethics committee.\n\nParticipants.Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform (MTurk) was used to recruit participants. MTurk is an international crowdsourcing website on which participants complete tasks or questionnaires for payment, and is increasingly being used as a source of valid and reliable data [28].\nThe questionnaires were completed 529 times. Participants were excluded for providing obviously repetitive answers (i.e. giving the same answer to all questions in at least three of the six questionnaires in the original battery; N = 5) or for completing the questionnaire battery twice (second attempt excluded; N = 19). This left a final sample of 505 participants (270 males, 235 females) aged 18 to 79 years (mean = 34.0, SD = 12.2). The majority of respondents lived in the USA (N = 457); other respondents lived in India (N = 35), Canada (N = 6), the UK (N = 6) or another European country (N = 1). The ethnicity of the sample was as follows: 72.3% White, 11.1% South Asian, 6.1% Black, 2.8% Hispanic, 2.0% East Asian and 5.7% Mixed/Other. The highest completed education level of the sample was as follows: 38.2% Bachelor’s degree, 30.9% Senior/high school, 18.8% College, 12.1% Postgraduate degree.\n\nMeasures.Psychopathic traits: these were measured with the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale Short Form (SRP-SF; [24]), a well-validated instrument modelled on the Psychopathy Checklist Revised (PCL-R; [1]). The SRP-SF contains 28 items that participants rate on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly disagree to 5 = Strongly agree). The SRP-SF yields scores for four dimensions of psychopathy: Affective (e.g. lack of empathy), Interpersonal (e.g. manipulativeness), Lifestyle (e.g. impulsive) and Antisocial (e.g. harmful and potentially criminal behaviour). There are seven items for each of the four dimensions, which can be summed to form a total psychopathy score. We chose to use the SRP-SF rather than the original SRP as it takes less time to complete, whilst still retaining strong psychometric properties [24].\nThe SRP-SF and the SRP on which it is based both have good basic psychometrics, as well as theoretically sound and mathematically strong latent structures [2], [6], [17], [29]–[33]. There is good evidence for convergent validity between the SRP/SRP-SF and other measures of psychopathic traits. For example, both measures are strongly positively correlated with the PCL-R and also have the same four-factor structure [24], and three factors of the SRP-SF (Interpersonal, Affective, Lifestyle) are strongly correlated with the three factors of the Youth Psychopathic Traits Inventory (Grandiose/Manipulative, Callous/Unemotional, Impulsive/Irresponsible; [32]). Finally, SRP subscales are strongly correlated with expected subscales of the Elemental Psychopathy Assessment, a measure of psychopathic traits based on the five-factor model of personality (EPA; e.g. SRP Interpersonal is strongly correlated with EPA Manipulation and Self-Centeredness [30]).\nAcross a wide diversity of samples, the SRP traits are associated in the expected theoretical directions with relevant external correlates, such as criminal offenses and externalizing psychopathology [32], [34]–[37], moral reasoning [17], amygdala activation to fearful faces [29], and lower amygdala volume [38]. The construct validity of both the SRP and SRP-SF are further supported by studies demonstrating theoretically meaningful associations with related personality measures [31], [33], as well as cognitive functioning [2], social information processing [16], and social functioning [6]. Based on the use of a mega world-sample (30 k+), latent variable model-based research with the SRP has shown it to be invariant across sex, and the SRP factors were associated with world regional data such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), fertility, and infant mortality [39]. In the current sample, Cronbach’s Alpha scores indicated acceptable to good reliability (mean = .76, SD = .10; Affective = .76, Interpersonal = .86, Lifestyle = .80, Antisocial = .61).\nSocial reward: the Social Reward Questionnaire (SRQ; [7]) is a 23-item scale used to measure individual differences in the value of social rewards. Each item begins “I enjoy” and then describes a different type of social interaction. Participants are asked to consider the item in relation to all their social interactions, e.g. friends, partners, family, colleagues or people they have just met. Responses are given on a 1 to 7 scale (1 = Disagree strongly, 7 = Agree strongly). The SRQ consists of six subscales, each representing a domain of social reward: Admiration, Negative Social Potency, Passivity, Prosocial Interactions, Sexual Relationships and Sociability (see Table 1). In the current sample, Cronbach’s Alpha scores indicated good reliability (mean = .82, SD = .04; Admiration = .82, Negative Social Potency = .87, Passivity = .78, Prosocial = .84, Sexual = .84, Sociability = .77).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 1.  Detail of SRQ subscales.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0106000.t001\nData analysis procedure.Pearson and Spearman correlational analyses (as appropriate depending on the normality of the bivariate residuals) were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 for Windows. Scores for the four psychopathy factors and the total psychopathy score were correlated with all SRQ subscales using zero-order correlations. Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate [40] was used to control for the probability of making a Type I error on multiple comparisons, and only corrected p-values are presented. There were no missing data, as the questionnaire was programmed in such a way that all items required a response.\n\n\n\nResults\nDescriptives for SRQ and SRP-SF scores are shown in Table S1. Results from the correlational analyses are shown in Table 2. All psychopathy scores were positively associated with the Negative Social Potency subscale of the SRQ and negatively associated with the Prosocial Interactions subscale. All psychopathy scores except the Antisocial factor were positively associated with Sexual Relationships, and all except the Affective factor were positively associated with Passivity. Finally, Lifestyle psychopathic traits were positively associated with Sociability, and Interpersonal psychopathic traits were positively associated with Admiration.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 2.  Correlations between SRP and SRQ scores in Study 1 (N = 505).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0106000.t002Post-hoc analyses.Previous evidence has shown that age and gender can affect both reward processing (age: [41]; gender: [42]) and level of psychopathic traits (age: [43]; gender: [44]). We therefore conducted post-hoc analyses to explore possible effects of age and gender on the associations between psychopathic traits and social reward (see Tables S5–S7).\n\nAge.We re-ran the correlations between the two measures as partial correlations, controlling for age (see Table S5). When age is controlled, the following associations are no longer significant: Admiration and Interpersonal psychopathic traits (r = .06, adjusted p = .24) and Passivity and Lifestyle psychopathic traits (r = .09, adjusted p = .07), and the association between Admiration and Antisocial psychopathic traits becomes significant (r = −.10, adjusted p<.05). However, the pattern of associations largely remained the same.\n\nGender.We re-ran the correlations between the two measures in Study 1 for each gender independently. We then used the Fisher r-to-z transformation to assess if the differences between associations for each gender were significant (see Tables S6 and S7). The pattern of associations was largely the same for males and females, but the differences are worthy of note. Firstly, females showed a stronger association between Sexual Relationships and Affective psychopathic traits (z = 2.19, p<.05). Four associations were significantly stronger in males than females: Passivity and Antisocial psychopathic traits (z = 2.79, p<.01), Sexual Relationships and Antisocial psychopathic traits (z = −2.86, p<.01), SRQ Sociability and Interpersonal psychopathic traits (z = 2.14, p<.05) and Sociability and Total psychopathic traits score (z = 2.05, p<.05).\n\n\n\nStudy 1 Discussion\nAll psychopathic traits were positively associated with Negative Social Potency and negatively associated with Prosocial Interactions. This supports our hypothesis of an ‘inverted’ pattern of social reward in individuals with high levels of psychopathic traits, in which being cruel is enjoyable and being kind is not. Affective, Interpersonal and Lifestyle psychopathic traits were positively associated with enjoyment of Sexual Relationships, consistent with our hypothesis and in line with previous evidence of increased promiscuity in these individuals [25]–[26]. In addition, there was a positive association between Interpersonal psychopathic traits and enjoyment of Admiration. The Interpersonal psychopathy factor includes manipulativeness and superficial charm, and we speculate that an admiring individual would be more susceptible to this manipulative control. Therefore, gaining others’ admiration could facilitate the self-serving social strategy of individuals with high levels of Interpersonal psychopathic traits, instilling this social interaction with high reward value. Additionally, admiration may be rewarding because it feeds the narcissistic traits associated with Interpersonal psychopathic traits [45].\nThere were positive associations between Interpersonal, Lifestyle and Antisocial psychopathic traits and enjoyment of Passivity. We speculate this may be due to the parasitic relationship style of individuals with high levels of psychopathic traits [1], [12], which may lead these individuals to enjoy social interactions in which another person expends effort to bring them gains. Lastly, there was a positive association between Lifestyle psychopathic traits and Sociability. We speculate that individuals with high levels of Lifestyle psychopathic traits may enjoy socialising with others because this provides a context for the risk-taking and sensation-seeking behaviours that this factor represents [1]. For example, attending parties may increase the opportunity to take recreational drugs.\nOur post-hoc analyses revealed some interesting effects of age and gender, although the pattern of associations between social reward and psychopathic traits largely remained the same. Overall, the associations found here between dimensions of psychopathic traits and different types of social reward provide evidence for possible motivations behind the patterns of social behaviour seen in psychopathy.\n\nStudy 2In Study 2, we tested a sample of UK participants in person. The first goal of this study was to explore the associations that we found between social reward and psychopathic traits in Study 1 in a different sample. The second goal was to use two experimental reward tasks to assess how monetary and social reward value relates to psychopathic traits. These experimental tasks were intended to provide a sensitive index of reward value that would be less susceptible to possible impression management than could be the case for self-report measures such as the SRQ. The tasks also allowed social reward to be explored in the context of another type of salient reward, money.\nTasks that compare responses to monetary and social reward are already available (e.g. [41]–[42], [46]). However, the stimuli used to represent the two types of reward are conceptually and perceptually different from each other, which somewhat complicates the interpretation of the findings from these studies. For example, one study [46] represented monetary reward often with a currency symbol (a dollar sign), a simple conceptual representation for which an association with reward has been learned over time. In contrast, social reward was represented with a smiling face: a visually complex, biologically salient image [46]. In order to comparably address individuals’ relative processing of monetary and social reward, there is a need to use stimuli that allow these two rewards to be represented as equally as possible. To address this issue in the current study, social reward was represented using the ‘Like’ symbol from the social networking site Facebook (www.facebook.com). This is a thumbs-up symbol used to express approval/admiration from one user to another in response to user-posted items, such as photos or comments. We then used a pound sterling symbol to represent monetary reward, and using these symbols together has two benefits. Firstly, both the Like and pound symbols are images that have a learnt association with reward. In other words, these symbols both indicate a conceptual representation of reward. Secondly, both symbols have similar, abstract visual features. Together, these characteristics allow us to compare the relative processing of monetary and social reward value as validly as possible.\nExisting studies of monetary reward value have shown that psychopathic traits are positively associated with increased activity in reward-related brain areas, such as the nucleus accumbens, when processing monetary reward [19]–[20]. In addition, behavioural research has found positive associations between psychopathic traits and importance of life goals relating to money [6]. We therefore hypothesised that psychopathic traits would be positively associated with reaction times (RTs) to reward in the monetary task. With regard to social reward, findings from Study 1 of this paper suggest that psychopathic traits are associated with less reward from prosocial interactions. On the basis of this, we hypothesised that psychopathic traits would be negatively associated with RTs to reward in the social task. Finally, we hypothesised that psychopathic traits would be negatively associated with a monetary–social RT difference score (i.e. RTs to social reward will be relatively slower than those to monetary reward). Based on the findings from Study 1, we hypothesised that all psychopathy factors would show this pattern of association.\n\nMaterials and Methods\nEthics Statement.All participants provided written informed consent and the study was approved by the University College London Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology Research Ethics committee.\n\nParticipants.Participants were 110 males recruited from two participant pools at University College London (UCL): the UCL Psychology Subject Pool and the ICN (Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience) Subject Database. Both pools are open to students across the university and to members of the public. Only males were recruited due to the higher prevalence of psychopathic traits in males and to ensure we did not lose power in the relatively small sample size by controlling for another variable (gender). Participants were aged 18–39 years (mean = 22.45, SD = 4.07) and all met the following criteria: fluent English-speaker, no dyslexia and a current Facebook user. Ninety percent of the sample were current students (6.4% unemployed, 3.6% employed) and all lived in the UK. The highest completed education level was as follows: 65.4% senior school/A level college, 19.1% Bachelor’s degree, 15.5% postgraduate degree. Ethnicity of the sample was as follows: 28.2% Chinese, 21.8% White other, 20.9% Mixed/Other, 19.1% White British, 10.0% Indian.\n\nQuestionnaires.Psychopathic traits: the SRP-SF [24] was used to measure psychopathic traits as in Study 1.\nSocial reward: the SRQ [7] was used to measure the value of different types of social reward as in Study 1.\nFacebook usage: use of the social media website Facebook was measured with the Facebook Intensity Scale [47]. This is an 8-item questionnaire that assesses frequency and duration of Facebook usage as well as emotional connectedness to the site. This measure was given in order to control for the effect of Facebook usage on the reward value of the ‘Like’ symbol in the experimental social reward task.\n\nMonetary and social reward tasks.Two versions of a probabilistic reward anticipation task (monetary and social) were used. These tasks were based on the Factorial Reward Anticipation task [48] and the Monetary Incentive Delay task [49]. The monetary and social tasks were conducted separately (rather than as part of one task) for two reasons. Firstly, separating the two tasks with a battery of questionnaires in-between reduced the possibility of boredom or fatigue effects. Secondly, conducting separate tasks removed the effect of shifting costs that could incur if participants had to change frequently between the two symbolic representations. Comparing two types of reward by using two separate tasks has been done previously (e.g. [21]).\nIn both tasks, a cue indicates how likely it is that a key press response will yield rewarding feedback. The participant then responds to a target by pressing the space bar, and subsequently receives feedback, which is either reward (a monetary or social point gain) or no reward (no point gain; there is no loss condition). Therefore, each trial has 6 sequential components: (1) 500 ms anticipatory cue, (2) 1500 ms fixation cross, (3) 500 ms green square target, (4) 1500 ms blank screen, (5) 1500 ms feedback, (6) 1000 ms inter-trial interval (each trial is 6.5 seconds). There are three possible cues, shown in Figure 1, which indicate to the participant that there is a p = 0, p = 0.5 or p = 1 probability level of receiving a point in that trial, provided they press the space bar quickly (within 500 ms) when the target appears. If the space bar is pressed within 500 ms on a rewarded trial (i.e. in 100% of the 1 probability trials and a randomised 50% of the 0.5 probability trials), ‘+1′ is presented with the reward symbol (either a pound or Like symbol). If the space bar is not pressed, is pressed outside of the 500 ms window, or is pressed within the 500 ms window but on a no-reward trial (i.e. in all 0 probability trials and 50% of 0.5 probability trials), ‘+0′ is presented with the reward symbol. On each feedback screen, cumulative winnings are shown underneath the trial winnings (see Figure 1). Within each task, the sequence of trials (0, 0.5 or 1) was randomised for each participant.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.  Monetary and social reward task trial sequences.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0106000.g001It is worth noting that no actual reward was awarded on the basis of task performance. Participants were given a flat rate of £10 for taking part in the study, and were told that the objective of the reward tasks was simply to earn as many points as possible. We made this decision because we wanted to keep the two tasks as equivalent as possible (i.e., translating the monetary points into winnings in the monetary condition could not be matched in the social condition). Therefore, we relied on the learned association between the two symbols (pound sign and Like symbol) and reward value. This is in line with other studies comparing the two types of reward, where winnings are not translated into actual monetary reward [41], [50].\n\nProcedure.Participants completed the questionnaires and monetary and social reward tasks as part of a wider data collection. One experimental reward task (either money or social; counterbalanced across participants) appeared at the beginning of the battery and the other appeared at the end (approximately 40 minutes apart).\n\nData analysis procedure.Zero order correlational analyses were used to assess associations between SRP-SF and SRQ, as in Study 1. Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate [40] was used to control for the probability of making a Type I error on multiple comparisons, and only corrected p-values are presented. There were no missing data, as the questionnaire was programmed in such a way that all items required a response.\nIn the experimental reward tasks, trials with RTs that were <100 ms or >1000 ms (including any missing trials) were excluded from analysis. According to these criteria, eight participants had >20% invalid trials in either the monetary or social reward task and were excluded from analysis, giving a final sample size of N = 102.\nMean reaction times (RTs) for each probability level (0, 0.5 and 1) were calculated in both conditions (monetary and social) for each participant. In addition, a difference score was calculated that represented the relative value of the monetary and social conditions. To do this, the mean score for each probability level in the social condition was deducted from the corresponding mean score in the monetary condition.\nWe first compared general task performance on the monetary and social tasks. A 2 (reward type: monetary, social)×3 (reward probability: 0, 0.5, 1) ANOVA was conducted to investigate this. To explore associations between psychopathic traits and performance on the experimental reward tasks, correlational analyses were run between the psychopathy factor and total scores and the mean RTs and monetary-social difference scores from the experimental tasks. Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate [40] was used, and only corrected p-values are presented.\n\n\n\nResults\nQuestionnaires.Descriptives for SRQ and SRP-SF scores are shown in Table S2. The four psychopathy factor scores (Affective, Interpersonal, Lifestyle and Antisocial) and total psychopathy score were all positively associated with Negative Social Potency, as in Study 1 (see Table 3). Affective and Antisocial factors were negatively associated with Prosocial Interactions. All scores except the Antisocial factor were positively associated with Sexual Relationships. Finally, only the Interpersonal factor was positively associated with Passivity and Admiration, and there were no significant associations with Sociability.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 3.

Analysis of simple effects showed that the decrease in RT between increases in reward probability (0 and 0.5; 0.5 and 1) were both significant, in both monetary and social conditions (all p<.05; see Table S4). There was no main effect of reward type and no interaction between reward type and reward probability.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 2.

However, Interpersonal psychopathic traits were significantly positively associated with the RT difference scores for the 0.5 and 1 probability conditions. Specifically, as Interpersonal traits increased, RTs to the social condition were faster relative to the monetary condition (see Table 4).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 4.  Correlations between SRP scores and reward task RTs and difference scores.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0106000.t004\n\n\nStudy 2 Discussion\nIn Study 2, the pattern of associations between psychopathic traits and social reward found in Study 1 was largely replicated. Specifically, in both samples there was a positive association between all psychopathy scores and Negative Social Potency, the enjoyment of being cruel and controlling towards others. Both studies found positive associations between Affective, Interpersonal, Lifestyle and Total psychopathic traits and Sexual Relationships, and a positive association between Interpersonal psychopathic traits and Admiration. Both studies also found a negative association between Affective psychopathic traits and Prosocial Interactions and Interpersonal psychopathic traits and Passivity, although Study 1 found these associations with all psychopathic traits. In addition, Lifestyle psychopathic traits were positively associated with Sociability in Study 1, but not Study 2.\nIn the social reward experimental task, a novel symbol of social reward was used: the ‘Like’ thumbs-up symbol from the social networking site Facebook. RTs to both the Like and pound symbol were faster with each incremental reward probability level. There were no significant differences between mean RTs in the monetary and social reward tasks. This suggests that the Like symbol was serving as a reward stimulus in a manner similar to monetary reward, and so it may have value in future studies of social reward.\nInterpersonal psychopathic traits were positively associated with the monetary-social RT difference score in both the 0.5 and 1 probability level conditions. Specifically, as Interpersonal traits increased, RTs in the social task became faster relative to the monetary task. We interpret this in the context of the narcissism and manipulation associated with the Interpersonal factor [27]. Specifically, the Like symbol represents social admiration/approval, and so this symbol may have a higher subjective value for individuals who tend to trick and manipulate others.\n\nIn the two studies reported here we explored associations between psychopathic traits and the value of different social rewards. The main finding from our studies was that individuals with high levels of psychopathic traits reported that they like behaving antisocially and dislike behaving prosocially towards others. Data from the experimental reward tasks suggested that individuals with high levels of Interpersonal psychopathic traits appeared to find social admiration/approval especially motivating relative to monetary reward. Together, these findings shed light on what might motivate the social behaviour characteristic of individuals with high levels of psychopathic traits.The implication that individuals with high levels of psychopathic traits enjoy cruel behaviour is in line with findings from other studies (e.g. [15]). A careful consideration of sadism is important here, which is defined as the enjoyment of controlling, dominating, and/or causing suffering to others, and can refer to physical or psychological suffering [51]–[52]. There is some existing support that psychopathy and sadism are overlapping constructs [53]–[56], and the current study provides further support for this. However, it remains unclear exactly why individuals with high levels of psychopathic traits enjoy cruel behaviour. One possibility is that inflicting suffering on others may be pleasurable purely because of causing a person pain (physical or psychological). Alternatively, the enjoyment may stem from the power and control that comes with inflicting suffering, and it is this rather than the pain per se that has reward value. Further research should probe the exact nature of the Negative Social Potency reward that is associated with psychopathic traits, and this value in antisocial behaviour should be incorporated into explanations of why psychopaths behave so badly towards others.In addition, the current study found a negative association between psychopathic traits and enjoyment of prosocial interactions (Study 1: all factors; Study 2: Affective factor only). This finding suggests that individuals with high levels of psychopathic traits do not just feel indifferent towards being kind and helpful, they find it unappealing. Psychopathic traits have previously been associated with an increased report of public prosocial behaviours but a decreased report of anonymous and altruistic prosocial behaviours [9]. This is consistent with the current findings as it appears that individuals with high levels of psychopathic traits do not experience an intrinsic reward from behaving prosocially towards others [9]. This contrasts with evidence from typical individuals, which shows that people behave prosocially at least in part because they experience inherent enjoyment from it (the ‘warm glow’ hypothesis of altruism; [57]–[58]). The absence of this enjoyment in individuals with high levels of psychopathic traits is an important avenue for further research as it likely contributions to their reduced levels of cooperative and prosocial behaviour (e.g. [8]).It is important to note that not all significant associations between psychopathic traits and social reward in Study 1 were replicated in Study 2. For example, Prosocial Interactions were negatively associated with all psychopathic traits in Study 1, but only Affective psychopathic traits in Study 2. There are a number of possible explanations for these discrepancies. For example, the two samples were drawn from different populations and the sample in Study 1 completed the questionnaires online rather than in the presence of the experimenter. These factors or others could have contributed to the difference between the two samples. It is also important to note the effects of age and gender seen in the post-hoc analyses in Study 1. It will be valuable to study social reward and psychopathic traits further to fully understand the relationship between these two constructs and how this might be influenced by demographic characteristics. However, the fact that the association between all psychopathic traits and Negative Social Potency was found in both samples, despite their demographic differences, suggests this may be a particularly important aspect of social reward for individuals with high levels of psychopathic traits.In Study 2, we also conducted two experimental reward tasks with the aim of further elucidating the relationship between psychopathic traits and social reward. There were no significant associations between psychopathic traits and RTs at any probability level of monetary or social rewards. However, a significant positive association was found between Interpersonal traits and monetary-social difference scores for the 0.5 and 1 probability levels. In other words, as Interpersonal traits increased, the RTs to possible reward became faster in the social task relative to the monetary task.As there were no significant associations between Interpersonal traits and RTs to either monetary or social conditions, these difference score associations are not clearly explained by either slower RTs to monetary reward or faster RTs to social reward. Rather, it is the relative difference between these two rewards that appears important, suggesting that individuals with high levels of Interpersonal traits confer relatively stronger value for social than monetary reward. It is important to note the type of social reward that the Facebook Like symbol represents: approval or admiration of one’s actions or lifestyle. The Interpersonal dimension of psychopathy describes the manipulative use of others, for which winning other’s approval may be particular useful. This may partly explain the relative importance that individuals with high levels of these traits placed on this type of social reward. This speculation is supported by the self-report findings from both samples reported here that Interpersonal traits (but not other psychopathy factors) were positively associated with the enjoyment of Admiration.We had hypothesised that psychopathic traits would be positively associated with RTs to monetary reward, but this was not supported. Previous studies have found that psychopathic traits are associated with increased neural responsiveness to monetary reward [19]–[20]. However, these associations were with neural responses, and have not been demonstrated behaviourally. Therefore, one explanation is that the association between psychopathic traits and hypersensitivity to monetary reward is only apparent at a neural level. In addition, both previous studies used a different measure of psychopathic traits (Psychopathic Personality Inventory; [59]) than the one used in the current study, which furthers limits the extent to which we can compare between studies. A hypersensitivity to financial gain may have important implications for behaviour, particularly in combination with other psychopathic characteristics such as impulsivity and a lack of empathy, so the relationship between psychopathic traits and monetary reward value is worthy of further clarification in future studies.Some limitations to the present study should be noted. Firstly, the sample size of the second study is small and the experimental findings should be replicated with larger samples. The current analyses were also exploratory and correlational. It would be interesting to test more directional hypotheses using more sophisticated regression analyses in the future. For example, it would be interesting to explore whether Interpersonal psychopathic traits predict performance in a social reward task above and beyond the variance shared with other aspects of psychopathic personality. Secondly, difference scores can be difficult to interpret, and it is important to further probe the relative contribution of monetary and social reward value to fully understand the current association between Interpersonal psychopathic traits and the monetary-social difference scores in the experimental tasks. In addition, it would be helpful to collect data measuring the subjective value of the Like and pound symbols for each participant, to assess the impact of this on task performance. Finally, the current study used community samples, and so it will be important to explore if the same pattern of associations between social reward and psychopathic traits is present in clinical samples.In summary, the current study presents evidence that individuals with high levels of psychopathic traits may have an inverted pattern of social reward: they devalue affiliative and prosocial interactions, and instead take pleasure in treating others cruelly. Our experimental evidence suggests that individuals with high levels of Interpersonal traits place particular value on gaining social approval, which we speculate may be due to their manipulative treatment of others and the usefulness of approval in this context. Research addressing social reward in psychopathy is in its infancy, and there are likely to be a host of different processes that contribute to the value of different types of social reward. An important future direction will be to extend the current findings by elucidating the mechanisms behind the ‘inverted’ social reward associated with psychopathic traits."

            "fulltext": "Introduction\nEmotional intelligence and its measurement\nThe concept of emotional intelligence (EI) entered psychological vocabulary more than 20 years ago [1] and quickly earned a high rank of popularity among researchers and practitioners. The original definition conceptualized it as “the ability to monitor one’s own and others’ feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them, and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions” ([1], p. 189). Because scientists assumed that this set of abilities explain important life outcomes [2]–[5], they immediately began inventing various psychometric tools suitable for the measurement of EI as an individual trait. With time, the domain split in two assessment strategies. The first relies on self-report questionnaires, and the assumption that people know how well they understand and deal with emotions. According to this approach, EI is typically measured through self-judgments, using items of the form “I often find it difficult to show my affection to those close to me” or “I understand my emotions well.” Self-report questionnaires require thorough insight into one’s mental state based on accurate feedback regarding the accuracy of the emotional abilities, which seems not to be true in most cases [6]. The second assessment strategy uses ability tests based on performance criteria. They are supposed to reflect a person’s actual level of EI development. Although the tests seem much more objective and informative than questionnaires, they require more time and effort, both in the process of their construction and during administration. Another difficulty with the ability tests of EI pertains to the scoring criteria. In the realm of human emotions, problems rarely have only one “true” or “correct” solution; therefore, scoring procedures must be based either on the consensual approach (i.e., the most frequent answer is regarded “correct”) or on painstaking experts’ judgments [7], [8].\nThe aim of this paper is to introduce a new instrument for assessing emotional intelligence, labeled the Test of Emotional Intelligence (Test Inteligencji Emocjonalnej, TIE). Our test is based on the theory developed by Peter Salovey and John Mayer [1], [2], [7]. According to this theory, EI involves a set of cognitive abilities used for processing emotionally relevant information. Specifically, the theory splits EI into four distinct, albeit correlated, abilities, also called “branches”: (a) Perception of Emotions, (b) Using Emotions to Facilitate Thinking, (c) Understanding Emotions, and (d) Managing Emotions [2], [7]. The first ability (Perception of Emotions) consists of proper perception, identification, and recognition of emotions in one’s own subjective experience, as well as in other people’s behavior. The second dimension, labeled Using Emotions to Facilitate Thinking, pertains to the assimilation of emotions with thinking and problem solving. The third ability (Understanding Emotions) consists of proper understanding of emotions, including the comprehension of triggering factors, phases of the emotional process, and proper sequencing of emotional states. Finally, the management of emotions (Managing Emotions) is the ability to regulate one’s own emotional states, as well as the ability to deal with other people’s emotions and feelings.\n\n\nTIE: objectives and assumptions\nA number of authors argue that EI is important for social functioning and can predict educational achievement or job performance beyond intellectual ability and personality factors [3], [9]–[13]. To explore these relationships, researchers and practitioners need psychometrically sound and conceptually comprehensive measures of EI. Although numerous methods of measurement have already been created [14]–[18], each of the existing tools has some disadvantages. The shortcomings of these measures are different; for some tests it is their length, for others – their insufficient reliability, or the additional equipment needed. Even the Mayer–Salovey–Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) [16], which seems the best validated performance measure to fully reflect the ability model of EI, cannot be applied without doubts, as it is not free from cultural specificity [19]. In general, the majority of all concise measures of EI are self-reports influenced by the respondents’ self-esteem and mood, and reflecting rather generalized social adaptation [20] than actual emotional skills, while the ability tests either require considerable time to administer or have limited conceptual coverage. Seeing that a perfect measure of EI has not been created so far, we believe that developing new tools is worthwhile, or even necessary. Both for research and diagnostic purposes, the collection of available tests should be systematically enriched and restored. Since culture can shape the experience and expression of emotions [21], alternative measurement instruments should be developed and validated within different cultural groups. Consequently, our aim was to develop a valid and reliable instrument tapping multidimensional construct of EI, based on narratives and experiences from an adequate cultural context. Staying within scientific bounds in the use of such terms as emotion and intelligence we opt for the ability-based approach and assume that maximum performance tests are the best tools for assessing EI. Hence, we created a performance-based scale covering the whole set of emotional abilities, which is brief and easy to administer in individual and group settings.\nThree assumptions have been made during the construction process of the TIE. First, we wanted to measure the actual abilities of people rather than their own opinions about themselves. The majority of people think that their own EI level is higher than the average [9], therefore performance tests seem much more objective and valid than self-report questionnaires. Second, we intended to create an ecologically valid test, in which solutions would not be scored on the “zero-one” basis. Social and emotional problems are usually too complex and ambiguous to justify such an approach. Therefore, we deliberately decided to give participants the opportunity to rank response options according to their decreasing appropriateness rather than to classify them as “accurate” or “inaccurate”. Third, we decided to base the scoring criteria on experts’ judgment rather than on statistical distribution of the results in the population. Assuming that EI is an ability, or a set of abilities, rather than a personality trait or preference [22]–[24], the most frequent test responses must be regarded as less appropriate than ones that are infrequent but produced by highly emotionally intelligent persons.\n\n\nAims of the study and research hypotheses\nThe aim of our empirical investigations was threefold. First, we intended to provide a detailed, in-depth look into the factorial structure of EI as measured with the TIE. In addition to the factor analyses, we planned to provide empirical data on TIE reliability and validity. To obtain this purpose, we assessed the test’s internal consistency and reported its relationships with established psychological measures, presenting both its convergent and divergent validity. Because ability tests of EI usually reveal systematic gender and age differences we also analyzed such group differences. Since the TIE is an ability measure of EI, in all cases we expected the results usually obtained for such methods. Below, we present the hypotheses in detail.\nFactor structure of the TIE.As the test has been based directly on Mayer and Salovey’s four-factor model [2], we first decided to test the factorial solutions endorsed by these authors for their MSCEIT [16], i.e., one-, two- and four oblique-factor solutions. These solutions reflect the authors’ theoretical assumption that general EI (one-factor solution) consists of four branches (four-factor solution), that may be grouped in sets of two due to their functional similarity (two-factor solution): Experiential (perceiving and using emotions) and Strategic (understanding and managing emotions). Additionally, based on initial theoretical analyses and preliminary CFAs conducted for the TIE [25], we propose and test an alternative area division with the abilities of perceiving and understanding emotions constituting the alternative Experiential area, and the abilities of using and managing comprising the new Strategic area.\nMore recent analyses of the MSCEIT (which remains our main standard of comparison, due to its reputation, popularity, and being the only instrument fully reflecting the ability model of EI) showed that alternative factorial solutions could be more adequate. Therefore, we added a nested modeling procedure endorsed by Palmer and colleagues [26]. This approach does not simply assume that some higher-order factors emerge from the lower-level sets of abilities. Instead, in line with the traditional model of intelligence introduced by Charles Spearman [27], it suggests that test item performance (and, in consequence, life-situation performance) is “loaded” by two different factors: general (the famous “g” factor in intelligence) and specific for particular task/situation (“s” factors). Interestingly, Palmer and colleagues found that EI can also be recognized as a sort of “traditionally understood” intelligence, with one general EI factor, and specific branch-level factors. This observation led us to verify the “nested” (as Palmer calls them) models, to resolve this theoretical bifurcation. Summing up, we decided to test four oblique-factor models: one-factor, four-factor, and two versions of two-factor solutions (with an alternative distribution of subscales between the area-level factors). Further, we applied the “nested” strategy, again testing two versions of two-factor models, a four-factor model, and, additionally, a three-factor model endorsed by Palmer and colleagues [26].\n\nGeneral Intelligence.If emotional intelligence indeed represents a kind of intelligence, tests of general mental ability should correlate with tests of EI; however, such correlation should not be very strong in order to exclude the possibility that both domains are impossible to discriminate [7]. Along with this assumption, numerous previous studies have demonstrated that EI, as measured by the ability tests, correlates at a very modest level (from .31 to .39) with verbal intelligence [7], [12], [28]–[30]. In the case of MSCEIT, most of the overlap with verbal intelligence is accounted for by the subscale of Understanding Emotions. Correlations with fluid intelligence are smaller but still significant [12], [31], [32]. We predict analogical results for the TIE.\n\nPersonality.The results concerning relationships between emotional intelligence and personality are ambiguous, mostly due to the fact that different EI measurement strategies produce different results. Conceptualizing emotional intelligence as a trait and assessing it with self-reports leads to considerable overlap between EI and the Big Five traits [33]–[35]. Not surprisingly, self-judgments of a trait described as a constellation of emotional self-perceptions [36] involving adaptability, assertiveness, social competence, and stress management [37] highly correlates with personality dimensions. Self-judgment scales assess variables relevant to motivation, social skills, and other areas of personality [12], and thus, overlap with the Big Five sometimes as much as the different scales of the Big Five overlap with each other [22]. However, if we define EI as an ability, not a preference or inclination, we should not expect significant relationships with major personality dimensions. Whether or not people are sociable or assertive, they might be intelligent about emotions. Along with that claim, many empirical studies [9], [12], [28], [30] show that ability-based EI shares only a small fraction of common variance with personality, if at all. For example, the MSCEIT correlated .25 with Openness and .28 with Agreeableness [12]. In line with these results, we predict that among five personality dimensions, the TIE would only have a modest relation to Agreeableness and Openness [38].\n\nTrait EI (self-report).Empirical research systematically confirms that self-reported scales do not predict ability assessments of EI well. Correlations between measures of trait EI and ability EI are invariably low [39] showing that the former belong to the realm of personality, whereas the latter pertain to the domain of cognitive ability. In direct tests, self-judgment-based responses are not highly correlated with measured abilities of perceiving, using, understanding, and managing emotions. Therefore, we expect significant albeit weak correlations of self-reported EI with the results of the TIE.\n\nPerception of emotions.Convergence among the most widely used ability test of EI (MSCEIT) and ability measures of emotional perception is rather low. For example, correlations between the MSCEIT and the Japanese and Caucasian Brief Affect Recognition Test [40] are no higher than r = .18; with “facial blends” [41] reaching only r = .14, while those of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test [42] reach r = .56. The first studies using the TIE show significant relationships between its results and the ability measure of emotional perception. Wojciechowski and colleagues [43] found that all four TIE branch scores were significantly correlated with the results of a computer test measuring individual effectiveness in recognizing facial expressions (The Face Decoding Test, FDT). Analyses revealed a systematic pattern of positive relationships between the TIE and FDT, with Pearson’s r ranging between .20 and .38, all significant at p<.01. We expect similar results in this study.\n\nGender.Although studies based on self-reports bring disparate findings concerning gender differences in EI [11], [14], , when performance indicators of EI are used, clear and repetitive results are observable: women score higher than men, and these differences are sometimes as huge as one standard deviation [4], [9]. We expect similar gender differences (with females scoring higher) in the present study.\n\nAge.According to the theory, EI should increase with age due to the accumulation of knowledge about emotion and its social context [46]. Nevertheless, studies designed to confirm this effect bring mixed results. Some researchers report significantly better scores on all four EI branches for older adults [7], some investigators [46] show older adults outperform younger participants on three out of four EI dimensions (no difference in perceiving emotions), while others – find no significant association between age and ability EI [47], [48] or even negative correlation between age and emotional perception [26], [49]. Most recently [50] it has been found that older people have lower scores than younger people for total EI and for perceiving, facilitating, and understanding emotions, whereas age is not associated with managing emotions.\nVisibly, according to some studies, EI grows with time, but in agreement with the others it declines with age as any other cognitive ability. Paradoxically, it might not be a contradiction. Probably, from childhood, through adolescence, until middle and old age people develop emotional abilities and gather the experiences building their EI. Inevitable age-related cognitive decline happens only in very old age and does not equally affect all aspects of EI. It seems that older people have difficulty perceiving emotions [51], but may outperform younger people in managing emotions. Therefore, we expect small albeit significant age related gains in each EI branch until middle age, and a small decline for the subscales of perceiving, using and understanding emotions (but not managing) for the oldest participants. Thus, for the three branches a quadratic relationship with age is hypothesized, whereas for the fourth one we anticipate a systematic linear growth across the lifespan.\n\n\nMethod\nEthical Statement\nThe study was approved by the ethics committee of the Institute of Psychology, the Jagiellonian University in Krakow. Participants provided written informed consent. In the case of participants under 18, written informed consent was obtained both from the participant and the guardian.\n\n\nParticipants\nWe analyzed data from 4642 people, combining about 30 studies conducted by our team and collaborators with broad experience in empirical research. Participants volunteered for studies with either no or little compensation (course credits or money). There were 2664 females and 1673 males in the sample (missing N = 305). The mean age of the sample was 25.47 (SD = 9.15, range 16–67). There were 644 high-school students, 1726 university students, and 773 employees in the sample (missing N = 1499). The structure of education in the sample of employees was as follows: primary N = 23, vocational N = 33, secondary N = 227, higher N = 247 (missing N = 243).\n\n\nMeasures\nAbility test of EI.Emotional intelligence was measured with the TIE. The test consists of four subtests representing consecutively Perception, Understanding, Facilitation, and Management of emotions (four labels of TIE subscales are slightly different from the labels of MSCEIT, but they pertain to the same theoretical model). Each subtest is defined by six item parcels. An item parcel consists of one problem situation in which people perceive, experience, manifest or use emotions, followed by three alternative responses. This is an example of such item parcel:\nSophie hits the table with a fist. She frowns, her face is glowing, and her teeth are clenched. Most probably:\n\n\n\n\na) She is watching a popular show on TV\n\n1 …… 2 …… 3 …… 4 …… 5\n\nb) Once again she hurt her finger while cutting bread\n\n1 …… 2 …… 3 …… 4 …… 5\n\nc) She was just told by a colleague that he will not help her to prepare an important project, because he is leaving for a last-minute holiday\n\n1 …… 2 …… 3 …… 4 …… 5.\n\nThe three answers are related to the same emotional problem, however, each of them asks about the accuracy of a different strategy or perception, and therefore they can be treated as separate items. The whole test consists of two parts with different instructions. In the first part, referring to Perception and Understanding, participants are asked to reflect on feelings and thoughts of persons who were involved in the described situations. The task is to evaluate, on a 5-point Likert scale anchored at the ends with a “very bad answer” and a “very good answer,” the probability that a person involved in the situation experiences alternative emotions. In the second part, referring to Facilitation and Management, test-takers are asked to indicate the most advisable action that a protagonist should implement in order to solve the problem. The task is to judge, on a similar 5-point Likert scale, the level of appropriateness of each of the three actions described on the answer sheet, ranging from “very ineffective” to “very effective.” Scoring is based on the similarity of a testee’s responses with answers provided by the panel of experts (52 professionals, including 13 psychotherapists, 14 trainers of management, and 25 HR specialists). The points are summed up separately for all branches and for the whole test.\n\nSelf-reported EI.Self-reported EI was assessed via the SSEIT [18], a brief scale based on Salovey and Mayer’s [2] original definition of EI. Individuals are instructed to give their level of agreement to 33 statements describing different aspects of emotional life (e.g., “I know why my emotions change”) on a scale ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree). The original English version adapted to Polish [52] in this research reached an internal consistency of .91.\n\nPerception of emotions.The ability of perceiving emotions in nonverbal signals was measured with the SIE-T, an instrument tapping the ability to recognize emotions in facial expressions [53]. The internal consistency was .84.\n\nFluid intelligence.Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices–RAPM [54], showing an internal consistency of .87, served as a tool to evaluate fluid intelligence.\n\nVerbal intelligence.The test based on Horn and Cattell’s [55] theory of crystallized intelligence served as a tool for assessing verbal intelligence. The participants are asked to classify 120 words to one of the following categories: (1) art, (2) biology, (3) science, (4) literature, or (5) geography and history. The score is calculated as the number of correct answers given in five minutes.\n\nPersonality.To assess personality dimensions, we employed NEO-FFI [56], [57] showing the following internal consistencies (α): .77, .68, .82, .80, and .68 for Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and Openness to Experience, respectively.\n\n\n\nProcedure\nSince the TIE is a paper-and-pencil test, it was possible to gather the data in small groups, normally not exceeding 10 persons. The participants worked in quiet settings, completing the test in a limited time of 30 minutes. Other instruments were administered according to standard instructions, usually after the participants completed the TIE test. The entire study lasted for 1 to 2 hours.\n\nResultsThe main analyses (descriptive statistics, factor structure) were accomplished using the whole sample. For other analyses (convergent and discriminant validity), we took into account those participants who completed relevant tests or questionnaires (e.g., RAPM or NEO-FFI).\n\nDescriptive statistics\nTable 1 provides basic descriptive statistics for four subscales and the total score of the TIE. The results are slightly negatively skewed, although neither skewness nor kurtosis indicators exceed an absolute value of 1.0, thus the score distributions may be treated as approximately normally distributed. Since neither floor nor ceiling effects can be discerned, it seems that the TIE provides enough space for assessment of individual differences in EI.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 1.  Descriptive statistics.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0103484.t001\n\nFactor structure and intercorrelations\nIn order to verify competing structural models of the TIE, the results have been subjected to confirmatory factor analysis with the LISREL software and its pre-processor, PRELIS [58]. We investigated eight models, in groups of four. The first group was tested using an oblique-factor modeling strategy: the four-factor model, based on the underlying theory of EI, the one-factor model, assuming the existence of the general EI factor, and two versions of the two-factor solution. The first (Two-factor A, Table 2) corresponds to the area division by Mayer and Salovey [2]. The second version (Two-factor B, Table 2) corresponds to the results obtained in the pilot study [25] in which Perception and Understanding entered the first factor, whereas the dimensions of Facilitation and Management formed the second.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 2.  Exact and close-fit statistics/indices (WLS) for TIE models.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0103484.t002The second group of models was analyzed using a nested factor modeling strategy [26]. In addition, in this case we tested a four-factor model and 2 two-factor solutions, as well as the novel model with three nested factors, endorsed by Palmer and colleagues. For the analyses we applied weighted least squares (WLS) estimation method. All solutions obtained an acceptable goodness of fit indicators (Table 2). Although the A and B two-factor models simply cannot be compared with each other due to an equal number of degrees of freedom, it seems obvious from all the applied fit indices that the solution proposed by the authors of the test (i.e., “B” model) is, in case of the TIE, definitely better than the original area division proposed by Mayer and Salovey [2]. The difference is visible both in traditional and nested factor modeling. For the oblique-factor group of models, the four-factor and two-factor “B” solutions revealed the lowest χ2/df ratio, i.e., proved to be the best fit-to-data. A comparison of the two models revealed supremacy of the four-factor model (χ2diff = 40.02, dfdiff = 5, p<.001) presented in Table 3.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 3.

Adding the “g” EI factor significantly improves the analyzed models’ fitness. Using the nested modeling strategy we have also confirmed the advantage of the four-factor solution over the two-factor “B” model (χ2diff = 49.85, dfdiff = 7, p<.001). These two models revealed the highest fit indices, surpassing the three nested factors solution that proved most appropriate in the case of MSCEIT (χ2diff = 43.18, dfdiff = 3, and χ2diff = 93.03, dfdiff = 10, respectively for two- and four-factor models; both significant at p<.001). Altogether, the CFA results suggest that the four-factor and two-factor “B” structures with nested factors should be preferred over the competing models.\nBased on the goodness of fit indices reported above, we chose the three models to present their factor loadings (Table 3). Note that in model 8, the Facilitation factor loadings become negative, suggesting that the model may be overestimated. The case is similar to the nested two-factor model analyzed by Palmer and colleagues [26]. Albeit their model had an excellent fit, it was considered unacceptable. Therefore, model 8 must be treated with high caution, even if it seems adequate when analyzed using oblique modeling. It is interesting that exactly as in the Mayer–Salovey–Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test [16], Facilitation proved to be the “black sheep” of EI abilities. In all, the two-factor “B” model in its nested version seems the most reliable solution with respect to the factorial structure of the TIE.\nThe correlational analyses revealed that four subscales of the TIE are mutually intercorrelated and strongly related to the total score (Table 4).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 4.  Correlations between TIE subscales and the total score.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0103484.t004\n\nReliability\nThe overall TIE reliability is r = .88. For the subscales, Cronbach’s alphas are: .70 (Perception), .69 (Understanding), .65 (Facilitation), .66 (Management). Additionally, we computed reliability indices for two parts of the test. For the first part (Perception and Understanding) Cronbach’s alpha is .81, and the respective value for the second part (Facilitation and Management), is .78. Coefficient alpha of the total score is adequate, reliabilities associated with the branch level scales are less satisfactory, although such estimates are common among tests in this area of research [41], [59], [60].\n\n\nValidity\nWe adopted several ways to evaluate the validity of the TIE (see Table 5). First, we looked at the discriminant validity, using two IQ tests. The total score of the TIE correlated with RAPM (N = 912) at the level of r = .35, p<.001, indicating a medium effect size [61] and with the Gc test (N = 474) at the level of r = .26, p<.001 (small effect size). The highest correlations with fluid and crystallized intelligence tests reached the subscale of Understanding (.37 and .36, respectively; medium effect size), which is consistent with the results reported by other researchers [60]. The remaining correlation coefficients ranged between .15 and .29. These medium strength intercorrelations suggest that EI, as measured with the TIE, and general intelligence are separate albeit interconnected mental abilities.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 5.  Correlations between TIE scores and measures considered for the validity examination.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0103484.t005To evaluate the discriminant validity of the TIE we analyzed its relation to NEO-FFI. In our study (N = 511), only Agreeableness correlated with TIE’s subscales (coefficients ranged between .11 and .14, p<.01) and the total score (r = .16, p<.01), revealing a small effect size according to Cohen [61]. These correlations were weak, explaining about 2.5% of common variance, at the most. Thus, our test proved its independence of personality, similarly to other ability measures of EI based on performance criteria, such as MSCEIT [30].\nLooking at the convergent validity of the TIE, we found that the total score of the TIE correlated with the SSEIT at a significant but low level (r = .16, p<.001, N = 648). As to the subscales, the correlation coefficient with SSEIT was insignificant for Understanding, while for others ranged from r = .11, p<.01 (Perception) to r = .18, p<.01 (Facilitation), thus only oscillating around the threshold of a small effect size [61]. The correlations between the TIE and the SIE-T were higher than with the SSEIT (r = .35, p<.001, N = 631), ranging from r = .26, p<.01 (Perception) to r = .37, p<.01 (Understanding) at the subscale level, showing medium effect sizes [61]. The self-report measure of EI revealed weaker relationships with the TIE than the ability test, despite the fact the latter referred to only one specific aspect of EI, namely: recognition of expressions of emotions.\nThe validity of an EI test can be evaluated not only via correlating its results with other instruments of the same kind, but also through analysis of group differences. In our study, women outperformed men in every subscale of the TIE, and consequently in the total score (Table 6). All differences are highly significant and the effect sizes are remarkable.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 6.  Gender differences in TIE: subscales and total score (N = 4369).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0103484.t006In case of the TIE, the effect of age was also confirmed. The correlation coefficient between age and the general TIE score was r = .05, p<.001 (N = 4530). The effect was similar for three out of four of TIE branch scores, with Pearson’s rs of .04, p<.01 for Perception, .05, p<.01 for Understanding, and .06, p<.001 for Management. Only for Facilitation the correlation with age was not significant, r = .02, p = .12. These results are in line with conclusions formulated by Mayer, Caruso, and Salovey [7]. Although the effect is very small and does not reach the small effect size threshold proposed by Cohen [61], it does not differ from EI-age correlations obtained for MSCEIT [26]. We did not find any evidence supporting the formulated claims on curvilinear changes in EI branches across the lifespan.\n\nThe main aim of the present study was to test the psychometric properties and factor structure of the new ability test of EI. We assumed that TIE’s results would conform to the theoretical assumptions of the four-branch structure of EI, specified by Mayer and Salovey [22]. Most of the formulated hypotheses were confirmed.The TIE proved its suitability as a reliable test of emotional intelligence. The internal consistency measures were rather high, as far as the total score is concerned, or mostly acceptable, if the particular subscales are taken into account. The internal consistency score at the level of .88 is a result very similar to the one usually found concerning Raven’s Matrices [54] or the MSCEIT [41], [62], [63], the most widely used tests of IQ and EI. Reliabilities associated with the subscales of the TIE were smaller, although such estimates are not unique among tests in this area of research. To point out only a few examples concerning MSCEIT: Caruso [64] reported a Cronbach’s of .74 (Understanding Emotions) and .76 (Managing Emotions), Roberts et al. [60] revealed .67 (Using Emotions to Facilitate Thinking), .68 (Understanding Emotions), and .68 (Managing Emotions). More recently, Austin [41] showed .58 (Using Emotions to Facilitate Thinking), .66 (Understanding Emotions), and .66 (Managing Emotions); and finally, Lopes and colleagues in one of their studies [65] obtained for Managing Emotions a split-half reliability of .57. Because of the fact that reliability measures concerning subscales of the TIE do not differ substantially from other tools of this kind [66], both the total and subscales may be used in the research, while for individual diagnosis it seems advisable to rely on the total score.The results of the TIE conform to the theoretical assumptions about the nature and structure of EI, specified by Mayer and Salovey [2], [7], [22]. This finding is good both for the theory, as its empirical support, and for the test, as an argument for its theoretical validity. At the same time, our study suggests that the between-branch connections may be conceptualized in a different manner than in the original theory. In Mayer and colleagues’ original conceptualization, perceiving and using emotions formed the experiential factor, whereas understanding and managing emotions loaded the factor of strategy [16]. This division is based on an observation that some emotional abilities enhance emotional knowledge and make one “closer” to one’s own and others’ emotions, and therefore comprise the “hotter” part of EI, whereas other abilities are usually treated as useful tools for “cold,” strategic regulation of emotion. However, this division of abilities remains a problematic issue. Whereas perception is clearly experiential, and management is definitely strategic, the understanding and facilitation branches are much more ambiguous. The former is manifested mainly in adequate labeling of emotions, as well as linking them with their causes and consequences. Accurate labeling is necessary for differentiation of similar emotional states; thus, to distinguish two different albeit similar affective states one needs to accurately feel these states, which makes the understanding branch experiential, at least to some degree. On the other hand, facilitation, also labeled “using emotion to facilitate thought” [2], [7], has much in common with processes of meta-cognitive control, and thus remains a very “applicable” and therefore strategic dimension.Our results imply that the Perception branch may be in fact situated closer to Understanding than Facilitation, while the latter seems to be more strongly connected to Management than to Understanding. This finding can lead to modification of Salovey and Mayer’s theory. Nevertheless, we suggest this interpretation with caution, realizing that our outcomes may result either from specific operationalization of respective branches of EI or from cultural specificity. However, our findings are generally consistent with the underlying theoretical assumptions and empirical data concerning the structure of emotional intelligence as a set of four abilities.Confirmatory Factor Analyses revealed that although four-factor models were characterized with the best fit indices, they should be treated with caution due to unexpected negative loadings of Facilitation branch. Therefore, the two factor solution with general-EI loading on each area seems much less ambiguous, and, in the light of the presented data, should be preferred over the remaining ones. The supremacy of the nested models suggests that EI, as measured with the TIE, has much more to do with intelligence (in the way in which Charles Spearman would want to see it, as loaded with general and specific factors), than with personality. Thereby, we provide further evidence for “the intelligence of EI” [7], based not only on the test’s convergent/divergent validity, but also on its factorial structure.Many studies introducing new EI methods face the problem of weak convergent validity. Our results seem to be in line with the empirical data published to date. The total score of the TIE correlated with self-reported EI at a significant but low level oscillating around the threshold of a small effect size [61]. Taking into account that both tools are based on the same theoretical model, one might expect much higher correlations, although such result is not an exception. The most elegant example was provided by Brackett and colleagues [9], who developed a self-judgment scale based on the Four-Branch Model and found a correlation of only r = 0.19 with the MSCEIT. More commonly used self-judgment scales of EI, such as Bar-On’s EQ-i [14] or the SSEIS [18] predict MSCEIT results better, but still at a pretty low level [12], [67]. MacCann and Roberts’s Situational Test of Emotional Understanding and Situational Test of Emotional Management [68] correlated with MSCEIT of .33 and .36, respectively. A very similar correlation of .36 has been found between the TIE and the PKIE, a self-reported measure of EI [69]. The problem of very low correlations between different measures of EI undoubtedly stems from inconsistences on a theoretical and psychometric level, and leads to the conclusion that self-assessed EI and ability EI measured by performance tests are different constructs.Despite the disparate forms of measurement methods, the correlations of the TIE and an instrument tapping the ability to recognize emotions in facial expressions were higher, revealing medium effect sizes [61]. As significant relations cannot be assigned to shared method variance in this case, such result provides support for the construct’s convergent validity.Compared with the convergent validity evidence, the discriminant validity evidence for the TIE is promising. According to the ability-based approach, emotional intelligence is not a personality trait, and thus its measures should not share much variance with major personality dimensions. Many empirical studies [9], [12],  showed that EI shares only a small fraction of common variance with personality. In line with that, the TIE proved its independence of personality. Weak, although significant, correlations with Agreeableness, and the lack of any other relationships with the remaining Big Five dimensions, should be interpreted as evidence that the TIE does not cover preferences, habits, or inclinations. The very moderate correlations between the TIE and measures of general intelligence suggest that EI is a set of mental abilities, related to intelligence, but quite independent of it. These findings are also consistent with EI literature [32], [60], [66], [70].Most tests of ability EI reveal systematic gender differences. Research proves that women tend to show greater knowledge of emotional experiences, provide more complex descriptions about emotions, and use a broader emotional vocabulary [71]–[73], and thus consequently regularly score higher than men on EI ability tests [4], [9]. Also in our study, women outperformed men in every single subscale of TIE, and consequently in the total score (with remarkable effect sizes). Such confirmation of the generally recognized phenomenon of women’s advantage concerning emotional abilities is additional evidence supporting the new test’s validity.According to Mayer and Salovey’s theory, EI should increase with age due to the accumulation of knowledge about emotion and its social context [7], [46]. Our results are in line with such prediction. Although the effect is small, it does not differ from EI-age correlations obtained for MSCEIT [26]. Since our sample did not include participants older than 70, we did not discover age-related cognitive decline in EI."

            "fulltext": "IntroductionAbundant evidence across the behavioral and social sciences suggests that there are substantial individual differences in pro-social behavior. While some people predominantly care about their own material outcome, other people with more pro-social motivations are often seeking to advance social goals and equality at their own cost. These insights, often supported by laboratory experiments, have had a decisive impact on the emergence of social preference theories [1]–[3]. Yet, to date it is unclear which psychological mechanisms underlie the observed behavior.\nEmpathy and Theory of Mind (ToM) are both regarded as central in social interaction relating to social emotions and social reasoning. Social emotions function as emotional responses to, for instance, unfair or fair decisions. Social reasoning is used to assess how others are likely to act in a given situation. Empathy is thereby the capacity to share social emotions of others. ToM is the capacity to understand the social reasoning and social emotions of others [4].\nParticularly prominent in the study of pro-social behavior and individual differences in social preferences are the Ultimatum Game (UG) [5] and the Dictator Game (DG) [6]. These paradigmatic games are regularly implemented to study decision making in neutrally and socially framed contexts. Studies have examined decision making using the UG and DG in various social contexts, for instance, by the means of displaying the face of the experimental participant before the interaction [7], [8]. Likewise, a vast array of studies has examined behavior in the UG and DG using a neutral decision context. The conventional practice of using neutral and abstract frames in economic experiments is a means to improve experimental control and elicit the underlying preferences in a given population. Using a neutral frame, the two games have been, for instance, employed in the parameterization of social preferences in the inequity aversion model by Fehr and Schmidt (1999), currently the most widely cited model on social preferences [2].\nIn the UG, a proposer chooses how much to offer from an initial endowment. A responder can either accept or reject. If the responder rejects, both will get nothing. In the DG, the responder must accept any offer made by a proposer. With its absence of strategic considerations, the DG is often regarded as a pure measure of pro-social behavior and hence lends itself to evaluating the role of empathy and social preferences [6]. Regarding the UG, across a large range of conditions, responders have been shown to reject low offers despite the consequence of receiving a payoff of zero [9]. These rejections have often been interpreted as evidence for social preferences (for alternative interpretations of UG rejections see [10], [11]). Given that a substantial share of responders in the UG will reject low offers, many inherently selfish proposers make apparently fair offers in order to maximize their expected pecuniary payoff. At the same time, those individuals better at forecasting what is the smallest offer still accepted by the receiver can use this knowledge to their material benefit. Because of its combination of strategic interaction and fairness concerns, the UG is particularly well suited to evaluate the role of ToM in strategic interaction.\nThis paper tests whether individual differences in empathy and ToM affect behavior in neutrally framed experiments which are frequently employed to measure social preferences. Scholars of cognitive science have stressed the importance of embodiment in emotion recognition and posit that ability to understand social emotions is grounded in primitive ability to share emotions through bodily interaction with other people and the environment [12]. Our study differs from the literature on embodied cognition in that we investigate the underlying psychological mechanism of social preferences in a neutrally framed context. This renders it possible to directly evaluate the role of empathy and ToM in social preference theories that are used for instance to predict economic behavior, analyze welfare implications and derive policy recommendations.\nOur results show that individual differences in the capacity for empathy, as measured through various psychometric tests, do not shape social preferences. At the same time, our results qualify the role of ToM in strategic interaction. We do not only show that fair individuals exhibit more accurate beliefs about the behavior of others but that ToM can be used to pursue both self-interest and pro-social goals depending on the principle objectives of the person.\n\nEmpathy\nLooking inside the black box of social preferences, one component that has been hypothesized to play a central role is empathy, the capacity to share the feelings of others. Adam Smith (1789, p. 10) already highlighted in The Theory of Moral Sentiments the potential role of empathy in pro-social behavior: “Empathy is the source of our fellow-feeling for the misery of others, that is by changing places in fancy with the sufferer, (it is) that we come either to conceive or to be affected by what he feels” [13].\nMore recently, a very similar stance has been taken in the perception-action model of empathy [14]. The model suggests that it is sufficient to observe or imagine someone else in an emotional state to trigger an empathic response. In a review article on the role of empathy and ToM in economics, the authors suggest that if empathy implies the shared experience of emotions, this can undermine the idea that choices are based solely on self-interest [15]. This is captured, for instance, by the inequity aversion model by Fehr and Schmidt (1999), in which an agent can experience not only positive but also negative utility if the agent's own and others' monetary outcomes differ [2]. In line with this reasoning, empathy has been listed among a number of pro-social emotions, such as guilt and shame, which underpin pro-social behavior in human decision making [16].\nIndividual differences in the capacity for empathy reflect differences in pro-social behavior in domains such as volunteering and donating [17]. In a group of young adults, measures of pro-social dispositions have been found to be stable across a period of five years and relate to ratings of empathy [18]. According to the empathy-altruism hypothesis, empathy is even regarded as the exclusive source of genuine altruism [19]. Empathic feelings are classically associated with helping someone in need [20], [21]. In the context of the Prisoner's Dilemma Game, inducing empathy via portraying the other person as needy resulted in participants choosing to cooperate more often than in a neutral control condition even when participants knew beforehand that the other person would defect on them [22].\nNeuroscientific experiments have indicated that people differ in their empathic capacity and that this might relate to individual differences in social preferences [23]. Inviting couples into the laboratory, participants received a painful stimulus and the resulting brain signal was compared to that obtained when they were merely informed that their loved one had received such a stimulus [24]. The same affective brain circuits were active both when receiving pain and when being informed about the beloved one experiencing the same painful stimulus. Importantly, the higher the activation in the pain circuits, the higher participants scored on a psychometric measure of empathy, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, which is also employed in the current investigation [25]. In a further study participants were initially exposed to a situation where they were treated either fairly or unfairly by a matched partner [26]. In the second part of the experiment, the matched partner received a painful stimulus. For men, empathy-related brain activity was found only in those who faced a fair partner and not in those who faced an unfair partner. For women, such a difference was not observed. The authors link these results on empathy to social preference theories, where people value others' gains positively if they are fair, but the gains of unfair partners are negatively valued.\nA number of researchers have hypothesized about the importance of individual differences in empathy for fairness as observed in neutrally framed laboratory games [15], [27], [28]. If allocators were explicitly asked to put themselves in the shoes of the recipient in the DG, offers increased as compared to individuals in a control group that were not given any specific instructions [28]. This illustrates that empathic behavior can be induced by changing the social context. In this study, we specifically focus on individual differences in empathy in a given context and how these relate to social preferences. Singer (2008, p. 264) reemphasizes a point made earlier by Singer and Fehr (2005) that “one prediction that can easily be made is that people with a greater ability to empathize should display more other-regarding behavior” [4], [27]. However, a clear-cut demonstration that individual differences in empathy underlie social preferences as classically measured in neutrally framed laboratory games is still missing.\nHypothesis 1: The greater the individual's capacity of empathy the higher the offer in the DG.\n\n\nTheory of mind\nEmpathy relates to the capacity to share social emotions. In contrast, ToM allows an agent to understand the social reasoning and social emotions of others. Utilizing ToM, the decision maker constructs the mental states of others making inferences about beliefs, intentions, and emotions [29]. The concept of ToM was initially proposed by primatologists who suggested that it emerged as a result of the social challenges of living in larger coalitions [30], [31].\nIn economics, Smith (1776) noted in The Wealth of Nations that understanding the goals and beliefs of one's trading partner facilitates business [32]. The centrality of ToM to strategic interaction implies that it closely relates to issues addressed in game theory. One basic assumption is that of “common knowledge,” which implies that interacting agents reflect on the action of the other and know that the other does the same [33]. More recently, the assumption that all people make the same inferences as others do has been challenged, and individual differences between agents in their thinking steps and hence in their capacity for ToM have been considered central to explaining a number of empirical phenomena [34], [35]. This echoes the hypothesis that Singer and Fehr (2005) postulated, by which individuals who have a higher capacity for ToM can better predict others' motives and actions [27].\nHypothesis 2: The higher the individual's capacity for ToM the more accurate the stated beliefs about the behavior of others.\nToM is thought to serve two functions: (i) It facilitates the pursuit of one's personal gains, a function that in the psychological literature has also been labeled Machiavellian intelligence [30]; and (ii) it facilitates pro-social behavior, as shown, for instance, in non-human primates where the capacity for ToM can lead to acts of spontaneous helping [36]. Surprisingly, to date, among humans there exists evidence only for the second function but not for the first. For instance, people high on the Machiavellian scale score low on the capacity for ToM, that is they do not seem to effectively employ ToM to further their own goals [37], [38].\nUsing economic games, researchers have studied individual differences in ToM among children but not adults: In the UG, 6- to 10-year-old autistic children, who are impaired in ToM, were more likely to accept low offers and to refuse fair proposals compared with a normally developed cohort [39]. Likewise, preschoolers who had acquired the capacity for ToM made higher mean offers in the UG than those who had not yet developed this capacity. This has led to the proposition that individual differences in ToM are a psychological component that underlie social preference theories in which those with a higher ToM are fairer [40].\nYet, these findings do not square with the proposition made in economics and game theory that those who seek to maximize their own monetary profit can benefit from an accurate estimation concerning others' likely action. The seminal study of Kelley and Stahelski (1970) on the role of beliefs in social dilemmas allows a reconciliation of these contradictory propositions [41]. The authors showed that cooperative individuals are more accurate than selfish individuals in predicting the actions of others in a social dilemma. They argued that this difference is functional in nature: To pursue their strategy successfully and reduce the likelihood that someone else takes advantage of their pro-social tendency, cooperative people need more accurate beliefs than defectors. For defectors it is unnecessary to make accurate inferences in a one-shot social dilemma, as doing so does not affect their strategic choice which is always to defect regardless what the other does. For those that consider cooperating, it is vital to accurately estimate what others do in order to be able to deduce the potential risk that is entailed in choosing to cooperate. A question that follows from this is whether people that tend to favor a strategy with a pro-social outcome are generally more accurate in estimating what others do regardless the specific context of the game. We used the DG in an attempt to distinguish the principal social preferences of agents, that is, whether the agents seek to maximize their own payoff or also care about the payoff of others.\nHypothesis 3: When comparing fair and selfish participants as measured by their offers in the DG, fair participants will have more accurate beliefs about the decisions of other participants than selfish ones.\nHowever, the situation changes when the focus is on those proposers in the UG who seek to maximize their own payoff. The more accurately a proposer judges the likelihood of a certain offer being rejected, the higher the expected payoff. Hence, in this context it becomes functional for the selfish proposers to have accurate beliefs.\nHypothesis 4: Selfish participants, as measured by offers in the DG, are more likely to employ accurate beliefs for their own material self-interest in the UG than fair participants.\n\nMethodsThe experiment was conducted at a German University where ethical review is standardized for conventional socioeconomic experiments such as this one. This implies that the treatment of participants was in agreement with the ethical guidelines of the German Psychological Society (DGP - see the guidelines: http://www.bdp-verband.org/bdp/verband/e​thic.shtml; particularly section C.II.4) and the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft). Specifically, all participants gave their written informed consent to participate voluntarily, assuring them that analyses and publication of experimental data would be without an association to their real identities. Moreover, random assignment to visually separated cubicles and private payment at the end of the experiment preserved the anonymity of participants. The experiment involved no deception of participants. As in other socioeconomic experiments, there were no additional ethical concerns.\nThe experiment was computerized and conducted in the laboratory of a large German University using z-Tree [42]. Participants were recruited via the online recruitment system ORSEE [43]. A total of 120 students took part in one of four experimental sessions. The vast majority of 87 female and 33 male participants were undergraduate students representing a wide range of different academic disciplines. We did not aim to recruit any specific gender composition. The academic disciplines of the participants were as follows: 31 social sciences (excluding economics), 22 natural sciences, 15 humanities, 12 law, 12 economics and business administration, 6 medicine and 18 other disciplines. The reported distribution of academic disciplines includes 116 individuals. We have excluded from the data set four non-native German speakers who indicated limited ability to understand some parts of the experimental instructions originally written in German. Each experimental session lasted about two hours. Earnings per participant ranged from 7€ to 26€ with a mean of 14€.\n\nBehavioral measures\nThe behavioral measures of our experiment consist of three separate sections. The first section includes three decisions to measure individuals' concern for fairness. The second section elicits participants' belief about the behavior of other participants in the first section. The third section measures participants' risk attitude using incentivized risk elicitation task. Decisions in all sections are incentivized by randomly selecting one decision from each section for the final payment (please see the Instructions S1 for the Experimental Instructions).\nTo measure an individual's concern for fairness, we had participants make decisions in three different roles: As a proposer in the UG and in the DG and as a responder in the UG. When participants must indicate their actions in all possible roles this has been labeled the strategy vector method [44]. When the strategy vector method has been compared to situations where participants play only one role in bargaining experiments, no major differences has been found [45]. These previous results lend support to the argument that individuals' concerns for others as measured in laboratory experiments are robust to elicitation through the strategy vector method. In the role of the responder, participants indicated the minimum acceptance level below which they would reject an offer. At the end of the experiment, one of the three decisions was picked randomly to calculate the monetary payoff. Participants were not informed whether they were matched with a different participant in each decision. This feature may in principle affect the behavior of various individuals.\nIn both games, the proposer was endowed with 90 experimental currency units (ECUs) and could split these in intervals of 10. An equal split is known to be the modal offer both in the UG and the DG. Hence, our research design precluded the possibility of making the modal offer. It has been shown that after removing the equal split, fair offers become less frequent [46] and that responders are less averse to unequal outcomes [47]. This provides a particularly interesting test bed for individual differences in ToM.\nParticipants were additionally asked to indicate their beliefs about the likely action of a randomly chosen partner in each of the three decision tasks (DG offer, UG offer, and UG minimum acceptance level). They thereby stated the probability they considered most likely for a given action by answering the question such as the following example for DG offers: “Please indicate the likelihood that a randomly determined person taking part in this experiment has chosen one of the 10 possible divisions”. Beliefs about the actions of others were rewarded based on the Quadratic Scoring Rule (QSR) [48]. It is used to measure and reward the accuracy of predictions. In our case, each participant states a probability vector r = (r1,…,rn) where ri refers to the probability that an event i occurs. The QSR is then used to give a reward of Q(r,j) where j is the event that actually occurs. The functional form of the QSRis strictly concave with respect to ri in which case the highest possible earning is received by placing 100% on the occurring event and zero probability on any other event. Participants get penalized for placing a positive probability on events that actually do not occur. The penalty is disproportionately increasing in the probabilities placed on those events. We set α = 10 and β = 10 which guarantees a positive payoff unless the participant assigns 100 per cent probability on a single false event in which case the participant receives no payment. An empirical assessment of various proper scoring rules (logarithmic, quadratic and spherical) show that participants are likely to employ various suboptimal reporting strategies when the score contains both positive and negative scores [49]. In our experiment, we have limited the QSR score to positive scores except in case where 100 percent probability is assigned to a single false event to facilitate truthful revelation. Schotter and Trevino [50] present a recent survey of the literature on belief elicitation in laboratory experiments and discusses among other techniques the QSR. Our implementation of the rule closely follows the standards for incentive compatible belief elicitation in economic experiments.\nThe QSR rule induces truthful revelation of subjective beliefs about the expected behavior of other participants in strategic games and is widely used to elicit beliefs in behavioral experiments [51]. To ensure full comprehension of the payoff mechanism, participants were carefully instructed on the procedure. Each participant had to go through three learning episodes with control questions that became increasingly difficult. A post-hoc analysis of the data shows that 93 per cent of participants provided the right answer to all three questions. At the same time, 96 per cent of participants provided the right answer to the most complex question (Question 3). However, a considerable effort and learning through trial and error was needed to gain full comprehension. Had we allowed only one attempt per question, only 52 per cent of the participants would have been able to find the right answer to all three questions.\nFor the purpose of paying, the QSR score for each participant in a given task was calculated on the basis of how well stated beliefs predicted the decision of another, randomly selected, participant. In order to make a robust assessment of the accuracy of beliefs and their relation to social preferences in the results section of the paper, the reported belief distribution of each participant was compared to the distribution of choices of all other participants. The belief assessment of every participant was matched with each of the observed outcomes in the study population, resulting in 115 scores, as there were 116 participants in total. We then computed for every participant a mean score for the three separate tasks and an overall score that is aggregated over the three tasks. These scores could range from zero to two. A score of zero indicates that the participant assigns 100 percent probability to a single false outcome. A score of two indicates that the participant assigns 100 percent probability to a single correct outcome.\nWhen beliefs and actions from the same participants are elicited in an incentive-compatible manner, participants might hedge across tasks that are independently incentivized. In other words, participants might take in some task higher risks to increase their chance of higher earnings and compensate for this in other tasks where they take lower risks ensuring that they get a minimum payoff. Previous studies however show that unless hedging opportunities are very prominent, results are unlikely to be confounded due to hedging [52]. Because participants did not know about the belief elicitation until they were actually asked to state their beliefs, the prominence of hedging opportunities between the games and belief elicitation tasks was not an issue here. Eliciting a separate belief distribution in each game may encourage participants to balance their reported beliefs. For example, participants could report systematically wider belief distributions in a certain game to secure a high minimum payment if this task gets chosen for the payment. As we only paid one randomly chosen belief elicitation task, such hedging should be minimized.\nA possible remaining confound is that participants adjust their reported beliefs to their risk attitude. Likewise, the practice of paying participants based on the action chosen by one randomly determined person may affect the reported belief distributions. This may invite risk-seeking participants to report narrower distributions centered on the option that they believe to be the most likely event. Risk-averse participants may be inclined to report flatter distributions to secure a high minimum payment. Not only beliefs but also behavior in the games might be shaped by individual differences in risk aversion. Greater risk aversion can, for example, lead to higher offers of proposers in the UG as these are less likely to be rejected.\nIn order to control for individual differences in risk aversion regarding the stated beliefs and decisions in games we used the Holt-Laury lottery task [53]. This is an incentive-compatible task where participants choose 10 times between two different lotteries that gradually vary the combination of probabilities and monetary outcomes in order to measure each individual's degree of risk aversion.\n\n\nPsychometric measures\nIndividual differences in the capacity for ToM and empathy have traditionally been assessed using psychometric tests. We used two tests that both measure empathy and ToM. The two empathy measures are convergent, whereas the two ToM measures complement each other: (i) “Cold” ToM is about inferences regarding the epistemic state of others and refers to the knowledge, beliefs, and intentions that someone else holds; (ii) “hot” ToM is about inferences about others' emotions [54].\nTo measure cold ToM and empathy, we employed the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI),which is the most widely used psychometric test to evaluate both empathy and ToM. The test has been extensively investigated and validated [25]. The German translation of the IRI, the Saarbrücker Persönlichkeits-Fragebogen [55] was used in the experiment. The IRI is a self-report questionnaire using abstract descriptions of social interaction which participants respond to. The modified version we used had four dimensions, each containing four statements. Two dimensions were used for the final analysis: Cold ToM was measured using the perspective-taking scale where participants responded to statements such as, “I try to look at everybody's side of a disagreement before I make a decision.” The capacity for empathy was measured with the scale for “empathic concern”. Participants had to respond to statements such as, “I often have tender, concerned feelings for people less fortunate than I.” Individual differences in the empathic concern scale correlate positively with brain activity associated with empathy [24]. Participants indicated the extent to which a statement described them on a 5-point scale, from does not describe me well to describes me very well. Cronbach's α was .73 for the ToM measure and .80 for the empathy measure, which correspond to the values found by Davis (1980) [25].\nA potential problem with psychometric tests, in particular regarding participants that are primarily motivated to increase their own earnings, is that responses are not incentivized. Specifically, Lyons, Caldwell, and Shultz (2010) point out that this might be problematic when it comes to assessing the relationship between ToM and Machiavellianism [38]. In their experiment, participants high on the Machiavellian scale showed a lack of effort in the ToM task, indicating that they might not have been sufficiently motivated by non-incentivized tests to reveal their ToM level. Note that measuring how accurate a participant's believes are what others will do in the games should be equivalent to how accurate a person is on inferring the epistemic state of someone else. The former is assessed using the QSR and is incentive compatible, the latter is assessed using the psychometric scales for ToM.\nTo measure hot ToM and empathy, we used the Multifaceted Empathy Test (MET), which employs 40 realistic photographs of faces expressing positive or negative emotions as stimuli [56]. The MET was originally developed to measure individual differences of empathy and ToM for people with autism as these have difficulties with abstract descriptions employed for instance by the IRI. The test is also suitable to measure individual differences in a normally developed cohort. It uses pictures as stimuli. Participants answered for each picture three types of questions reflecting three subscales. The subscale emotion recognition measured hot ToM by assessing to what extent participants could correctly infer the emotional state of others as depicted in the photographs. Participants answered the question, “What does this person feel?” by selecting one of four possible options, where only one was correct. A similar test for hot ToM, relying on emotion recognition in faces, was used by Paal and Bereczkei (2007) and Lyons, Caldwell, and Shultz (2010), who found a positive relationship between cooperativeness and the capacity for ToM [37], [38]. To measure empathy, the Multifaceted Empathy Test provides two subscales: The subscale direct empathy asked participants to answer the question, “How strongly do you feel with this person?” The subscale indirect empathy asked the question, “How aroused are you by the picture?” Direct and indirect empathy were measured with a 9-point scale ranging from not at all to a lot. Cronbach's α was .95 for direct empathy, .96 for indirect empathy, and .70 for hot ToM, which correspond to the values found by Dziobek et al. (2007) [56].\n\n\nExperimental procedure\nParticipants did not know about the content of the separate sections of the experiment at the beginning of the experiment but were informed about the subsequent tasks after the completion of each section. However, participants were aware of the content of the individual tasks within each section before submitting their decisions. For example, when reporting their beliefs about the expected behavior in the DG, participants knew that they are also requested to report their beliefs concerning UG behavior.\nHalf of the participants played the DG, then the UG, followed by the psychometric tests; the remaining participants completed the psychometric tests first and then played the games. We did not find any order effects between the psychometric tests and games. We therefore have pooled the data. Subsequently, participants indicated their beliefs about the likely actions of others in the games. This was followed by measuring participants' risk attitude. Questions on the demographic background of each participant ended the experiment. Participants received their earnings in cash immediately after the completion of the experiment.\nWhen analyzing the data we exclude from the dataset four non-native German speakers, who indicated limited ability to fully respond to the verbal descriptions of emotional states used in one of the psychometric tests. Furthermore, the data reveal that 13 participants reported non-monotonic risk preferences. These individuals are excluded from the analysis when analyzing the impact of risk aversion on participants' decisions and belief formation.\n\nResultsWe find that the mean offer is 25 percent of the endowment in the DG and 40 percent of the endowment in the UG. Modal offers in both games are equally high at 44 percent of the endowment. The mean of the minimum acceptance level in the UG is 26 percent of the endowment and the mode is 33 percent of the endowment. These observations suggests that people in our experiment display a substantial degree of pro-social behavior and reflect the common findings in the literature [9].\nDoes a greater capacity for empathy result in higher offers (Hypothesis 1)? We find that the two empathy measures are highly convergent (IRI-Empathy and MET-Direct empathy, r = 0.59, p<.01, for a table showing correlations between all psychometric tests see Table S1) and estimate separate regression models for each empathy measure as depicted in Table 1. The data show no significant relationship between the empathy measures and offers in the DG or UG. Likewise, various alternative behavioral indexes of altruism (e.g., the UG offer minus the UG belief about the minimum acceptance level, the belief about the DG offer by fellow participants minus the DG offer) do not uncover any statistically significant relation.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 1.  Determinants of the Dictator and Ultimatum Game offers – OLS regression.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0092844.t001We find that individual differences in Cold-ToM as measured by the Interpersonal Reactivity Index do weakly correlate with the DG offers. This finding is in line with previous studies on non-strategic social tasks that have found a positive relationship between pro-social behavior and ToM [37], [38]. A potential explanation suggested by the previous studies is that the origins of human social intelligence lie in the need for cooperation. In this case, people who aim to be fair also need to have a high functioning ToM. At the same time, the lack of monetary incentives in both studies might have not provided an adequate test-bed for assessing the role of ToM among selfish individuals. Notably, we find that risk aversion as measured by the Holt-Laury lottery task significantly and positively influences UG offers, suggesting that strategic considerations in the UG are moderated by individual differences in risk preferences.\nAn important question from both a behavioral and a methodological perspective is whether greater capacity for ToM elicited using the psychometric scales relates to higher accuracy in the stated beliefs (Hypothesis 2). The results in Table 2 are surprising. In particular, cold ToM as measured through the psychometric scales does not relate to ToM as measured by the accuracy of stated beliefs. At the same time, while the accuracy of beliefs can in principle be influenced by differences in risk attitudes, we find no support for this conjecture. Correlation between the accuracy of beliefs and risk aversion is statistically insignificant for all three measures of accuracy (DG and UG offers, minimum acceptance level in the UG: r<.22, p>.12).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 2.  The relationship between ToM and accuracy of beliefs in games.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0092844.t002A possible explanation for the lack of a relationship between the accuracy of beliefs and psychometric ToM measures is that a neutrally framed laboratory experiment is a context in which many of the cues that psychometric tests rely on are stripped away. Even the IRI measure of ToM which is based on abstract description of social interaction likely does not relate well to the simple set-up of games. Yet, the present laboratory setting provides a very specific measure of how good a participant is in judging the action of others which closely relates to ToM: participants stated what they belief others do in the games and were rewarded for their accuracy. The resulting score of accuracy of beliefs then is a laboratory specific measure in how far ToM might inform action.\nTo test our third hypothesis that fair participants have more accurate beliefs than selfish participants, we use a mean split of the DG offers to distinguish between fair and selfish participants. Alternative definitions of selfishness (e.g., median split or offering nothing) yield qualitatively very similar results to those obtained with the mean split applied here. Note that we do not find evidence to support the conjecture that participants' risk aversion is associated with the dispersion of reported beliefs. This result is robust to different measures of statistical dispersion (variance and kurtosis).\nSimilarly, behavior in the three belief elicitation tasks is not affected by risk aversion. To address the issue of potential risk hedging between the three belief elicitation tasks we compute various measures for statistical dispersion (variance and kurtosis) and test whether there are systematic differences in reported distributions between the tasks. Our results show that the measures of statistical dispersion remain fairly stable between the tasks. Correlation coefficients between the variances of distributions are as follows: DG and UG-Proposer: 0.52; DG and UG-responder: 0.57; UG-Proposer and UG-responder: 0.60. Correlation coefficients between the kurtoses of distributions are as follows: DG and UG-Proposer: 0.36; DG and UG-responder 0.38; UG-Proposer and UG-responder: 0.45. The used data set excludes four non-native German speakers and 13 individuals who reported non-monotonic rick preferences in our test for risk aversion. In addition, we exclude two individuals who reported uniform belief distributions with a variance of 0 and undefined kurtosis. See Table S2 for the complete table and a comparison between fair and selfish participant (Table S3) where the data reveals no significant difference. This leads us to conclude that the participants do not systematically balance their reported beliefs between these tasks. It should be acknowledged, however, that this does not entirely rule out the possibility that some individuals might have been hedging at the individual level.\nThe accuracy of beliefs is, as described above in the Behavioral measures section, measured by participants' ability to assess the behavior of fellow participants. The scores for each of the three tasks and test statistics are summarized in Table 3. In support of our third hypothesis, comparing beliefs of fair and selfish participants, we find that fair participants evince a higher accuracy of beliefs about offers made in the DG and UG compared to selfish participants. However, note that there is no difference between fair and selfish participants in the accuracy of beliefs concerning the minimum acceptance level in the UG. Being able to estimate this well would be of particular relevance for selfish participants who seek a high payoff.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 3.  Mean accuracy of beliefs across all three tasks.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0092844.t003Do individuals capitalize on their accuracy of beliefs in the UG (Hypothesis 4)? To estimate the expected monetary earnings for each participant from the UG, we first calculate how often a participant's offer in the UG is accepted by comparing a participant's UG offer with each of the 115 decisions about the minimum acceptance level made by the responders. We label this value a participant's expected acceptance rate. By multiplying the expected acceptance rate with the UG offer, we compute expected monetary earnings for each participant.\nModels 1 and 2 in Table 4 show how selfish and fair participants employ their accuracy of beliefs in the UG. We find that the accuracy of beliefs is strongly associated with larger expected earnings among selfish individuals, whereas there in no such relationship among fair individuals. The result is robust to controlling for risk aversion and demographic variables. The finding suggests that selfish participants effectively utilize ToM in service of their own material goals. In other words, the higher their accuracy of beliefs, the higher their expected earnings.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 4.  Determinants of expected earnings in the UG among selfish and fair individuals - OLS regression.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0092844.t004Individual differences in empathy and Theory of Mind (ToM) have been hypothesized to underlie differences in social preferences as observed in neutrally framed laboratory games. The Dictator (DG) and Ultimatum Game (UG), feature particularly prominently as measures to elicit such preferences. Indeed, as Kirman and Teschl (2010, p. 311), state “it would, of course, be very convenient if individuals had a certain fixed level of empathy which was independent of the context in which they found themselves in” [15]. Individual differences in empathy as measured by psychometric scales have been found in a number of instances where pro-social behavior is observed, such as volunteering, donating and helping someone in need. These observations lend support to the empathy-altruism hypothesis [19]. Neuroscientific evidence also points in this direction: Empathy-related brain activity is observed in participants when another person who had previously acted in a fair manner receive a painful stimulus [26]. Here we show that contrary to what has been hypothesized in the literature [4], [15], [16], [27], [28] in neutrally framed games individual differences in empathy do not correlate with pro-social behavior. However, we do not claim that these findings necessarily extend to socially framed conditions.An important element that the above-cited examples have in common highlighting the relationship between empathy and pro-social behaviour is that they resemble situations where another person can be perceived as needy. Indeed, moving from a neutral context to portraying someone in need increases the pro-social behavior of participants [22]. However, this still leaves open why social preferences are observed in neutrally framed laboratory games.A different route linking social preferences to individual differences has been suggested in the research on ToM. Specifically, cold ToM is defined as the capacity to make inferences regarding the epistemic state of others. Forming beliefs what others are likely to do reflects exactly this capacity. Intriguingly, accuracy of beliefs and the psychometric measures specifically for the capacity for cold ToM are not correlated. A likely reason for this is that the psychometric ToM measures are not able to capture the cues that people respond to in the games. However, ToM as revealed by the accuracy of beliefs strongly relates to the games. The literature suggests two different functions, i) ToM can be applied to pursue one's own material payoff; ii) ToM can facilitate pro-social behavior. We show beliefs in the games have the two functions that the literature ascribes to ToM. Fair participants have more accurate beliefs about the offers made in the DG and the UG compared to selfish participants. However, in the context where it is functional for selfish participants to have accurate beliefs, such as in the role of proposer in the UG, the difference between fair and selfish participants vanishes. In fact, accuracy of beliefs about the responder's minimum acceptance level positively affects earnings for selfish but not fair participants. This suggests individual differences in how accurately people can predict the behavior of others, which conventionally is understood as a feature of the capacity for ToM, play out differently depending on the social preferences that people harbor. Yet, where do these differences originate from that lead people to pursue diverging objectives?A potential source are personality traits which, akin to individual differences in capacities, are measured using psychometric scales, are fairly stable in an adult, and are considered an important factor in shaping decisions [57]. Using the Big Five [58], the most widely used personality measure, out of the five traits only extraversion was found to have a weak positive relation with offers in the DG [59]. However, using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator [60] offers in DG and UG did not correlate with extraversion, introversion, or individual differences in perception or judgment [61]. Using the same psychometric scale, a further study finds that extraverts have a somewhat lower minimum acceptance level [62]. Taken together, the research on personality traits suggests that there is some conflicting evidence regarding a connection with social preferences.Considering the psychometric scales for ToM applied here we find a weak positive correlation between cold ToM, which tests for inferences with regard to the epistemic state of others, and offers in the DG. We find no correlation to hot ToM, which relates to inferences about others' emotions [54]. A possible explanation for this is that social emotions, induced, for instance, by the neediness of someone involved, did not feature in our neutral experiments. The weak positive correlation between DG offers and cold ToM has also been found in other non-strategic settings and has been suggested to be due to the fact that ToM was employed by participants who acted more fairly to match social expectations [37], [38]. Concerning a strategic setting, a positive correlation between ToM and offers has only been found in studies with children [39], [40]. In contrast to our study, these games were not played anonymously but an experimenter was paired with each child and was present at all times. Such a design can invite a demand effect where participants want to appear fair. The importance of social expectations and subtle demand effects on behavior as observed in the DG and UG has been pointed out by a number of studies. For instance, when proposers in the DG are given the option to opt out by accepting a payoff that is lower than what they could gain in the game, about 40 percent of participants opt out. This leaves the receiver without payoff and ensures that she never knows that a DG has been played [47], [63]. Such an effect is present in a number of studies on the DG and UG which find that greater anonymity or the possibilities to obscure the role of the proposer decreases offers [64]–[67]. Future research is needed to specify the exact relationship between demand effect and individual differences in ToM.Expectations or beliefs also feature in studies that suggest that behavior in neutrally framed DGs and UGs can substantially vary with the environment people live in. When observing the action of others, people form beliefs about what others are likely to do and commonly adopt similar behavior [68]. Comparing different student populations shows that the longer a student has studied economics the lower are offers in the DG whereas those studying social work maintain relatively high offers in the DG throughout their studies [69]. Manipulating the beliefs what others do can cause large shifts in DG and UG offers and the minimum acceptance level in accordance to what the perceived majority choice in the group is [68], [70], [71]. This suggests that beliefs have an important role in games which are commonly used to assess people's social preferences. Similarly, we show that fair and selfish participants differ in their beliefs about what others do and also employ their skills about forecasting what others do differently. Future research would need to address whether a possible important source of observed individual differences in social preferences as observed with a conventional pool of participants can be due to the different environments that people come from when attending laboratory experiments."

            "fulltext": "Psychopathology, especially depression, is the most important risk factor for suicidal behaviour [1,\n\t\t\t\t2] with between 25% and 40% of depressed patients attempting suicide [3] and about 3.4% completing suicide eventually [4]. Given recent figures suggesting that the lifetime prevalence of a major depressive episode among the US population is 32.6–35.1 million [5], it is no surprise that suicide ranks among the top ten causes of death in many other countries [6].\n\t\t\t\nUnderstanding the aetiology of a significant public health issue such as suicide is important but difficult because of its complex and multifactorial origins. Although most suicidal behaviour occurs within the context of a mood disorder, most depressed individuals never attempt suicide. Furthermore, no linear relationship between the severity of the depressive episode and the likelihood of suicide has been forthcoming [7], highlighting the importance of other factors in addition to psychiatric illness. These factors include substance abuse or alcoholism, a head injury, a dysfunctional family or childhood abuse [8], high rates of gun ownership [9], smoking [10], socioeconomic adversity [11], and personality factors [12].\n\t\t\t\nGenetic factors may also be very important [13,\n\t\t\t\t14]. Marusic and Farmer [15] argue that the variation in the suicide rate across European countries (7–43 per 100,000 inhabitants per year) cannot be explained by sociocultural factors alone and is probably due to shared genetic vulnerability. A case in point is the high suicide rate in Hungary and Finland, two populations with a common genetic origin but with divergent cultural and political trajectories [15]. \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                 Colours of Depression(Illustration: Raj Ramesar)\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pmed.0030107.g001At the family level, the risk of suicide is higher in individuals with a family history of suicide [16,\n\t\t\t\t17], and the suicide rate of adolescents is highly correlated with the suicide rate among their relatives [18]. Even studies that have controlled for levels of psychopathology have shown that relatives of suicide completers and attempters are at an increased risk for suicidal behaviour [19,\n\t\t\t\t20]. Twin studies indicate that this familial clustering of suicidal behaviour has a partly genetic basis with heritability estimates of 17%–55% for suicidal behaviour [21,\n\t\t\t\t22] and 20% for suicide [23] reported. The only adoption study we are aware of suggested that as far as suicidal behaviour is concerned, adoptees resemble their biological parents more than the adoptive family [24].\n\t\t\t\nThese data have catalysed the search for genes that predispose to suicidal behaviour, with more than 100 studies now published [25]. Post-mortem studies of people who committed suicide have led to the general consensus that a disturbance of the serotonergic system is associated with suicidal behaviour. Therefore, it is no surprise that most of the genes implicated in suicidal behaviour—the serotonin transporter (SERT), tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), and the serotonin receptors, 5-HTR1A, 5-HTR2A, and 5-HTR1B—modulate central serotonergic function (see      Table 1). As is the case with most complex traits, however, success tends to plateau at a point where good candidate genes are identified but conclusive causal inferences remain elusive because of replication failures.    \n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 1.  Association Analyses of Genes Predisposing to Suicide or Suicidal Behaviourdoi:10.1371/journal.pmed.0030107.t001The unequivocal identification of genes related to psychiatric disorder is retarded by a complex interplay of latent environmental influences or gene–environment interactions; genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous samples; the possible effects of numerous loci of small effect size; and the difficulty of adequately correcting for multiple testing. Faced with these frustrations, the use of endophenotypes as an aid to molecular genetic investigations has become almost de rigueur. In the case of suicide, a number of researchers have advocated the use of personality traits as endophenotypes [12,\n\t\t\t\t26].\n\t\t\t\nWhat Is an Endophenotype?An endophenotype is an intermediate trait that lies somewhere on the developmental pathway from genes to phenotype [27]. If suicide is the phenotype of interest—the final product of different genetic and environmental factors—then the endophenotype is a more elementary trait that is tightly correlated with suicide. The genetic architecture of the endophenotype is assumed to echo its relative phenotypic simplicity, presenting a more tractable target for geneticists. An understanding of the molecular basis of the endophenotype should theoretically be the first step towards the larger prize: uncovering the molecular basis of the phenotype itself.    \nGottesman and Gould [27] assert that for a biological marker to be classified as a bona fide endophenotype, it must meet the following conditions: 1) be associated with the illness in the relevant population; 2) be largely state-independent, manifesting in the individual during both periods of health and illness; 3) be heritable; 4) within families, the endophenotype and illness should co-segregate; 5) if found in affected individuals should also be found in nonaffected family members at a higher rate than in the general population.    \nIn the following sections we use Gottesman and Gould's [27] five criteria above to evaluate the latest trend in suicide research: the merits of using an endophenotype such as personality to identify suicide susceptibility genes.    \nAre Specific Personality Traits Associated with Suicide Behaviour?Four main constellations of personality characteristics are associated with suicidal behaviour: impulsivity, hostility–aggression, introversion, and anxiety-neuroticism.\nA rich body of data details the association between suicide attempts and impulsivity. Impulsivity has been shown to be a risk factor for suicidal behaviour in a variety of adults [7,\n\t\t\t\t8,\n\t\t\t\t28–30] and adolescents [11,\n\t\t\t\t31,\n\t\t\t\t32] with psychiatric illness, in a forensic psychiatric population [33], and in the general population [34].\n\t\t\t\nFreud regarded suicide as an aggressive act, a view borne out to some extent by modern data. Simon et al. [35] found that involvement in physical fights was associated with violent suicide attempts, and, according to Appleby et al. [36], people who committed suicide were more likely to have been arrested in the previous six months. Cavanagh et al. [37] confirmed that a criminal record is a risk factor for subsequent suicide. Fulwiler et al. [38] detected a higher rate of suicide attempts in a group of violent compared with nonviolent patients with psychiatric illness, and in South Africa conduct disorder was found to be the most frequently made diagnosis in suicidal adolescents [39].\n\t\t\t\nNegative affect or anxiety is most commonly measured in the form of neuroticism from the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) or the Five Factor Model (FFM) inventory (see Glossary). Neuroticism is a higher order trait that measures a predisposition to experience anger, anxiety, depression, guilt, and other negative emotions or cognitions. A significant relationship between neuroticism and suicidal ideation has been regularly demonstrated [11,\n\t\t\t\t22,\n\t\t\t\t40,\n\t\t\t\t41], and the same holds true for neuroticism and attempted suicide [28,\n\t\t\t\t42–46]. High levels of anxiety or negative affectivity have been equally implicated in completed suicide [47–50].\n\t\t\t\nA number of studies have reported introversion to be associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviour [42,\n\t\t\t\t51–53]. In two psychological autopsies of completed suicides, Duberstein et al. [50] detected lower levels of extraversion in their cohort, and Maser et al. [53] found that people who committed suicide were shyer and less optimistic than other affectively ill patients. Extroversion has been shown to predict levels of social support [54,\n\t\t\t\t55], perhaps explaining the association between introversion and suicide.    \nSuicide attempts may occur in the context of an acute psychiatric crisis, biasing self-report measures of personality. One way of mitigating this problem is to use longitudinal data. In a study of 921 three-year-old children, Caspi et al. [52] found that impulsive toddlers were at an increased risk for suicide attempts at age 21. Fergusson et al. [11] followed a birth cohort for 21 years and similarly reported that high neuroticism and novelty-seeking were risk factors for suicidal behaviour. Similarly, a prospective study of affectively ill patients by Maser et al. [53] identified impulsivity as a key risk factor for both completed and attempted suicide, and Epstein et al. [48] found an association between high impulsivity and completed suicide.    Epstein et al. [48] also found that physicians who committed suicide had shown increased levels of hostility. Berglund [56] detected more irritability or aggression in people with alcoholic dependence who completed suicide. Among children who received treatment at a child guidance clinic, aggressive feelings and acts were predictive of later suicide [57], while among adult men both spontaneous and reactive aggression scores were elevated in later suicides [58].\n\t\t\tWhile depressed affect certainly has the potential to bias personality data, there is enough evidence from longitudinal studies to support the hypothesis that certain personality traits, in particular hostility–aggression and impulsiveness, predispose to suicidal acts. In the next section, we examine the genetic basis of some of these personality traits."

            "fulltext": "IntroductionUntil recently, research has focused on factors that hinder well-being, with the objective of identifying means by which to ease suffering [1]. Over the last fifteen years, however, many psychology researchers have insisted on the necessity to extend these studies by analyzing the individual differences and the processes that contribute to well-being [2]. One objective of this latter research is to highlight individuals' available means to boost their subjective happiness. According to Duckworth, Steen, and Seligman [3], these means are threefold: increasing pleasure, boosting engagement, and finding meaning in life. As pleasure is the fruit of experiencing positive emotions, increasing their frequency, intensity, or duration is one of the avenues through which individuals can achieve higher levels of happiness [4]. Indeed, a growing number of cross-sectional, longitudinal, and experimental studies show that positive emotions play a key role in individuals' evaluation of their level of well-being and contribute to numerous related benefits (for a review, see [5]). For example, at the cognitive level, experimental studies have shown that inducing positive emotions broadens individuals' scope of attention [6] and increases their creativity [7]. At the somatic level, longitudinal studies have shown that positive emotions are associated with increased longevity [5], [8]–[11], which is not surprising, as experience of positive affect was associated with better immunity in cross-sectional [12], [13] and experimental studies [14], [15]. At the social level, positive affect is related to better interpersonal relationships [16]–[20] and generally increases altruism [21], [22]. As a whole, these studies point to the importance of positive affect at both the individual and the societal levels and highlight the importance of developing interventions aimed at increasing positive affect and, consequently, well-being.\nTo provide clinicians with practical and efficient interventions, researchers have created and validated a set of techniques that enable individuals to increase their positive emotions and their levels of well-being (for a review, see [23]). In this area of research, techniques were frequently tested one at a time and presented to participants as one-shot exercises. This way of proceeding enables researchers to test the efficacy of each exercise individually. However, recent research [24] has shown that this way of testing interventions has low ecological validity because, in naturalistic settings, happiness seekers often practice (and wish to practice) multiple exercises at the same time. Furthermore, the use of multiple techniques in an intervention often produces better results than when a single technique is used alone [24].\nSeveral authors have tested interventions aimed at consolidating multiple techniques, provided as either individual or group sessions (e.g. [25]–[27]). Criteria used to determine a technique's inclusion in those programs were not always clearly defined or explicitly reported. In the 1980s, Fordyce [25], [26] gathered a set of exercises aimed at teaching happiness seekers to mimic typical behaviors and thinking styles of happy people. The exercises included in Fordyce's program encouraged participants to: (a) keep busy and be more active; (b) spend more time socializing; (c) be productive at meaningful work; (d) get better organized and plan things out; (e) stop worrying; (f) lower expectations and aspirations; (g) develop positive, optimistic thinking; (h) become present-oriented; (i) work on a healthy personality; (j) develop an outgoing, social personality; (k) be yourself; (1) eliminate negative feelings and problems; (m) see close relationships as the number one source of happiness; (n) put happiness as your most important priority ([26], p.484). In a more recent attempt, Seligman, Rashid, and Parks [27] created a program gathering the “best-documented exercises” in the literature ([27], p. 776) targeting at least one of the three components of “happiness,” as defined by Seligman (i.e., positive emotions, engagement, and meaning) [4]. Exercises integrated in Group Positive Psychotherapy were the following: (a) using your strengths; (b) three good things/blessings; (c) obituary/biography; (d) gratitude visit; (e) active/constructive responding; and (f) savoring ([27], p. 776).\nAlthough these studies provided essential information about the potential of integrative interventions, this kind of program would greatly benefit from a strong theoretical background which should (1) at a theoretical level, allow a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying happiness enhancement and (2) at a more practical level, help practitioners identify their clients' needs, weaknesses, and the most appropriate technique(s) to prescribe them [28]. As no happiness enhancing program that is both integrative and theory-driven currently exists, we decided to create such a program and to evaluate its effects on a set of mental and physical health variables. To this end, we developed an integrative program structured around a conceptual framework, which enabled us (1) to select a set of techniques involving different underlying processes and (2) to organize them in a coherent manner.\nThe model proposed by Quoidbach et al. [28], [29] appears to fulfill these requirements. As outlined below, Quoidbach et al. modeled positive emotion regulation strategies with reference to a well-known model in the domain of negative emotion regulation: Gross' Process Model of Emotion Regulation [30], [31]. This model enables the integration of strategies involving clearly differentiated emotion regulation processes and the reconciliation of studies on both positive and negative emotion regulation.\n\nThe Process Model of Emotion Regulation applied to Positive Emotions\nThe Process Model of Emotion Regulation [30], [31] provides a theoretical structure for analyzing emotion regulation processes. The model highlights five families of emotion regulation strategies. Initially created to understand and organize negative emotion regulation strategies, it was later adapted by Quoidbach et al. to apply to the up-regulation of positive emotions (see The Process Model of Positive Emotion Regulation, Quoidbach et al. [28], [29]). The first family of strategies that can be used to influence emotion is situation selection. Situation selection involves “choosing or avoiding some activities, people, or places in order to regulate emotions” [32]. To illustrate this strategy, we can imagine a grandfather, Joseph, deciding to visit his children and grandchildren on Sunday afternoon because he knows that being in touch with his family gives him a lot of pleasure.\nThe second family of strategies highlighted by Gross, situation modification, includes techniques that allow an individual to change the situation s/he is facing (or that s/he has planned) in order to change its emotional impact. To continue our example, in order to make Sunday afternoon fun and enjoyable, Joseph may decide to bring his grandchildren’ favorite board game that they all like to play together.\nAttentional deployment includes strategies that involve altering how an individual feels by selecting the information to which s/he attends. During Sunday afternoon, rather than getting irritated by the noise of the neighbor's lawnmower, Joseph may fully focus his attention on the fun game he is playing with his grandchildren. Along the same line, Joseph may concentrate his attention on the taste of the wonderful cheesecake his daughter prepared and deeply savor it to get the most pleasure from it.\nCognitive change refers to changing the way an individual thinks in order to change the way he/she feels, either by changing how he/she thinks about the situation itself or about his/her capacity to manage its demands. For instance, rather than taking the moment for granted, Joseph may interpret his presence among his family that afternoon as a gift of life.\nFinally, the last family of strategies proposed by Gross is response modulation. This family of strategies involves techniques to alter bodily manifestations of emotion (e.g. physiological, behavioral). In order to increase his excitement and pleasure during the time he is spending with his family, Joseph may decide to smile and laugh with his loved ones and to express his affection for them.\nGiven that generating a high level of well-being implies reminiscing about past positive events, savoring the present, and anticipating positive future events [33], [34], [35], Quoidbach et al. [28], [29] divided Gross's model into three moments of action: before, during, and after the positive emotions generating event (for a detailed description of the model, see [28], [29]). Thus, Quoidbach et al. [28], [29] do not propose five large families of strategies, but rather 15 distinct strategies that an individual can use to regulate his/her emotions, corresponding to the 15 sections of the Process Model of Positive Emotion Regulation (see Table 1, see italics).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 1.  Example of positive emotion regulation techniques in the Positive Emotion Regulation Model proposed by Quoidbach & al. [28], [29] for a specific positive event.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0095677.t001The use of such a framework makes it possible to classify the different types of techniques that individuals may use to maximize their positive emotions. Table 1 illustrates a positive event and the means an individual may use to increase the intensity, frequency, and duration of the positive emotions that s/he experiences. Each action (or technique) that an individual can implement in order to up-regulate his/her positive emotions with respect to a given positive event finds its place in one of the model's sections. As this model enables the integration and organization of happiness enhancing techniques, it offers an interesting framework with which to elaborate our intervention.\n\nThe Current StudyThe aim of the present study was twofold: (1) to create an integrative intervention (i.e. including multiples techniques) on the basis of a theoretical model and (2) to evaluate its impact on psychological and physical well-being variables.\n\nFirst Objective: Creation of the Positive Emotion Regulation (PER) Program\nTo achieve our first objective, we carried out an extensive literature review on the basis of the model proposed by Quoidbach et al. [28], [29] in order to identify a set of validated happiness enhancing techniques that we could include in our intervention. For each technique, we identified at which moment of action it was applicable (i.e., before, during, and/or after an event). We then evaluated the family of strategies to which each of these techniques corresponded. By combining this information, we were able to identify the strategy (or section) of the model to which each technique corresponded. This theoretical framework provided us with a structure in which to organize these validated techniques within an integrative intervention seeking to regulate positive emotions and to increase individuals' well-being.\nThis selection and classification process led us to include the following techniques in our intervention (see Table 2 for a detailed overview of the PER program, the extensive manual is available upon request from the first author). Techniques in the situation selection section aim at teaching people the kind of events they should plan (see B1 in Table 2, corresponding to “Before an event”), experience (see D1 in Table 2, “During an event”), or remember (see A1 in Table 2, “After an event”) in order to increase their level of well-being. These techniques included the following: playing sports [36], being altruistic [37], socializing [38], taking care of one's needs [39], goal setting [40], monitoring progress toward a goal [41], and identifying memories to preserve [42] or to recall [43].\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 2.  Week-by-Week Summary of the Positive Emotional Regulation Program.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0095677.t002Techniques in the situation modification section aim to modify planned (B2) or current (D2) activities, or their memories of these activities (A2), in order to optimize their well-being potential. Techniques such as time management and planning [44], job crafting [45], optimizing the end of an event [46], finding the flow [47], and showcasing souvenirs [48] were included in this category.\nAttentional deployment techniques help individuals to project themselves into a pleasant future (B3), to be fully present in an agreeable moment (D3), or to relive happy or meaningful moments of their lives (A3). Exercises such as imagining your best future self [49], mental time traveling to a pleasant future [50], savoring [51], and mental time traveling into past positive events [52] are examples of techniques in this category.\nTechniques identified as cognitive change strategies aim at helping individuals to interpret future (B4), current (D4), and past events (A4) in a positive way and to make individuals aware of the good things in their lives. This category of techniques includes optimistic thinking [53], reducing one's expectations [54], counting one's blessings [55], counterfactual thinking [56], writing a gratitude letter [57], and what-went-well exercises [58].\nFinally, in the response modulation category, we gathered techniques used to facilitate positive emotion expression for future (B1), current (D5), and past events (A5). Included exercises are sharing excitement for upcoming events [59], smiling [60], sharing good news with others [61], capitalizing [62], and gratitude visits [63].\n\n\nSecond Objective: Evaluation of the PER Program's Effectiveness\nOur second objective was to quantify the effectiveness of the developed program. To achieve this, we sought to compare the results of the participants in the PER program to those of individuals who didn’t participate in any intervention program (control group on a wait list). To identify the potential added value of our PER program to existing methods, we sought to compare the PER results to those of an intervention that (1) also seeks to increase positive emotions and well-being, (2) has been previously validated, and (3) can be administered in six two- to three-hour weekly sessions, followed by exercises to be completed at home. A literature review enabled us to identify the loving-kindness meditation (LKM), “a meditation technique used to increase feelings of warmth and caring for self and others” [64], as a technique that fulfilled all these criteria. Fredrickson, Cohn, Coffey, Pek, and Finkel [65] have shown that practicing this type of meditation significantly increases positive emotions as well as life satisfaction, while decreasing depression symptoms. The other types of validated interventions proved unsatisfactory as a control group, as it seemed inappropriate, and possibly counter productive, to organize an intervention around, for instance, an exercise such as “Counting One's Blessings” (e.g. [55]) and to ask participants to practice only this exercise during the six weeks of intervention (two hours/week in a group session, in addition to the follow-up exercises to be done at home). As our objective was to compare two interventions with a common aim, similar pace, and equivalent duration, LKM seemed to be the most appropriate validated option to serve as a point of comparison to adequately measure the effectiveness of the PER program.\nThus, by comparing these three conditions (PER program, LKM, and the control) we tested the hypothesis that, compared to the control group, the two interventions would enhance subjective happiness and life satisfaction and diminish depression symptoms, the frequency of physical symptoms, as well as perceived stress, as measured through self-report questionnaires.\n\n\nMethods\nEthics Statement.This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Psychology Department at the Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium, and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\nParticipants and Procedure.One hundred and thirteen undergraduate students (88 women; mean age  =  22.29, SD  =  2.49) took part in the study on a voluntary basis without any financial or course credit compensation (in order to guarantee intrinsic motivation to participate). They responded to an advertisement referring to “a six-week happiness enhancing training”. After providing written informed consent, they were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: the Positive Emotion Regulation (PER) intervention (N = 36; 32 women), the Loving-Kindness Meditation (LKM) intervention (N = 35; 27 women), or the waiting list (control group; N = 42; 29 women). The study advertisement was intentionally vague to keep participants blind to the multiple conditions and to allow a random assignment between the three.\nMeasures were taken one week before the intervention (T1) and four weeks after (T2), to evaluate medium term results. Among the participants who followed the complete 6-week training program (PER, N = 32; LKM, N = 20, attrition discussed below), four in the PER condition and four in the LKM condition failed to complete T2 measurements; they were, therefore, removed from the sample. In the control condition, seven participants did not complete the T2 assessment; they were also excluded from analyses. Analyses of mental health and physical variables presented below are, therefore, based on a final sample of 79 participants broken down as follows: PER, N = 28 (24 women, mean age = 22.5, SD = 3.06); LKM, N = 16 (13 women, mean age = 22.25, SD = 1.7); and control group, N = 35 (24 women, mean age = 22.14, SD = 2.35). Note that there were no significant differences on baseline measures between participants who completed T2 measures and those who did not (ps ranging from.086 to.897).\n\nTrainings format.The Positive Emotion Regulation (PER) and the Loving-Kindness Meditation (LKM) interventions were developed according to the same format (length, pace, and organization) and differed only in terms of content. The participants of each of these two conditions were divided into three small groups comprising ten to 14 individuals in order to establish effective group dynamic conducive to learning. For six consecutive weeks, both experimental groups participated in once-weekly, two-hour training sessions. LKM and PER group sessions sought to give participants a theoretical framework to understand the importance of the presented techniques on the one hand and, on the other, to enable them to experiment with and to practice certain exercises during the session before implementing them at home. Our program was therefore structured around theoretical and experiential methods [66] in order to maximize learning transfer (see [67], [68] for reviews and transfer guidelines).\n\nConditions.Loving-kindness meditation: This training was a French adaptation of the training proposed by Fredrickson et al. [65] and was created on the basis of the material we received from S. Finkel, the LKM trainer in this study. The only difference was in relation to the duration of the “on-site” sessions that were two hours long (as opposed to 60 minutes in the session proposed by Fredrickson et al. [65]), so that the duration of the LKM intervention could be comparable to that of the PER program. As Sin and Lyubomirsky [23] have shown that the duration of an intervention using happiness enhancing techniques is positively correlated to its effectiveness, we considered this modification to be essential. The longer session duration was achieved by adding basic meditation exercises as well as by increasing the duration of the “on-site” LKM exercises and of their debriefing. As in the Fredrickson et al. study [65], the LKM group participants were asked to practice 20 minutes of meditation at home, at least five days a week. Participants were strongly encouraged to continue their LKM practice after the end of the program. LKM sessions were led by two highly experienced mindfulness trainers (Christophe Dierickx and Gwenaëlle Rivez) that were trained in LKM through multiple readings, significant amounts of practice, and supervisions.\nPositive Emotion Regulation: As we explained in the introduction, the intervention was structured around the Process Model of Positive Emotion Regulation. During the group sessions, each section of the model was set out and put into practice through validated techniques (see Table 2 for examples). Research findings were presented to highlight the pertinence of the strategies and techniques proposed. The presentation of the strategies relative to the different sections of the models was divided across six sessions. As in the LKM condition, PER group participants took part in the exercises proposed during the session and received a list of exercises to carry out at home for the following week (combination of mandatory and self-selected exercises for a duration equivalent to 5 × 20 minutes). At the end of the program, participants were asked to identify exercises that worked the best for them (which is not necessary equal to their preferred ones, [69], see discussion section for more details), and were strongly encouraged to continue them after the end of the intervention. PER trainers (five psychology students and one Ph.D. student, operating in pairs) were a little less experienced group trainers than LKM trainers (which is why they worked in pairs), but were highly knowledgeable about positive emotion regulation topics.\n\nMeasures.Subjective Happiness was measured using the well-validated Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS; [70]). This questionnaire provides a global, subjective assessment of whether the respondent considers himself/herself as a happy or an unhappy person, via four items rated on a 7-point Likert scale. The internal consistency (α) was.91 at T1 and.87 at T2.\nLife Satisfaction was assessed with the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS; [71]). This scale comprises five items (e.g. “So far I have gotten the important things I want in life”) rated on a 7-point scale. The internal consistency was.81 at T1 and.86 at T2.\nDepression was measured via the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; [72]). In the present study, we used the short version [73], which consists of 13 items rated on a 4-point scale. Respondents were instructed to choose the response that best described how they felt over the last week. The internal consistency of the scale was.82 at T1 and.87 at T2.\nPerceived Stress was evaluated using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; [74]). This scale comprises 10 items (e.g. “In the last month, how often have you felt that you were unable to control the important things in your life?”) rated on a 5-point scale (0 = never, 1 = almost never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = fairly often, 4 = very often). The internal consistency was.86 at T1 and.69 at T2.\nSomatic complaints were assessed through a short version of the Pennebaker Inventory of Limbic Languidness (PILL; [75]; short-version [76]). The abbreviated scale consists of a list of the 29 most common physical symptoms (e.g., headache, stomachache, sleep problems, cramps). Participants had to rate on a 5-point scale the frequency with which they experienced each symptoms/sensation during the past month (1  =  never or nearly never, 2 = 1 to 3 times, 3 = every week, 4 = several times a week, 5 = every day). The internal consistency was.86 at T1 and.91 at T2.\n\n\n\nResults\nPreliminary results.Dropout analysis revealed that among the 36 participants assigned to the PER group, four of them left the program before its end (11% of the subjects). Among the 35 participants assigned to the LKM condition, 15 of them withdrew before the end ( =  43%). A Chi-square test revealed that the dropout difference between the two groups was significant, X2 (1, N = 71) = 9.125; p<0.003. No differences between subjects who dropped out and those who did not were found on the variables under study at T1, according to t-test analyses (ps ranging from.486 to.967).\nA one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to check for potential group differences at T1 between completers of the three groups (see Table 3 for the values). This analysis indicated that there were no significant baseline differences between groups on any of the following variables: subjective happiness, life satisfaction, depression, perceived stress, somatic complaints, and age (ps ranging from.247 to.935). Difference in sex ratios among the three groups was nonsignificant, according to a Fisher's exact test conducted on the number of remaining males and females after dropout among each group (p = .268).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 3.  Means (and Standard Deviations) for Each Scale and Each Group and Significance of Differences Between Time 1 and Time 2 for PER and control group.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0095677.t003\nTest of our hypothesis.In order to assess the evolution of participants' scores within each group, we computed change scores by subtracting T1 scores from T2 scores for each participant on each variable. A graphic depiction of mean change scores (expressed in percent) by group can be found in Figure 1.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.

Analyses showed that the mean difference score for SHS tended to be greater in LKM and PER than in the control group. The effect was only marginally significant (p = 0.08) but the power was low (P = 50%). The mean difference score for BDI tended to also be greater in LKM and PER than in the control group. Again, the effect was only marginally significant (p = 0.09) but the power was low (P = 48%). The mean differences for SWLS and for PSS were not statistically different between groups (ps = .24 and 0.11, respectively), but the power of the analyses was again very low (P = 31% and 44% respectively). Finally, the mean difference score for PILL was statistically different between groups (p =  0.018, P = 73%): the control group differed significantly from LKM (p = 0.044) and marginally from PER (p = 0.065).\nAlthough these results are somewhat informative, the very low powers of the analyses are problematic. Statistical power can be interpreted as the probability of finding a significant difference, if it exists, with the present sample sizes and the observed effect sizes. The conclusion that can be drawn from those results is that, for our effects to be statistically significant, we would need a much larger sample size. When power analyses are used to determine the optimal size of a sample before the beginning of a study, standards recommend powers between 80 to 95% [77]. Though the power of our study was far from this standard, this was a pilot study, and as such, we were unable to predict (1) the dropout rate in each group, and therefore the adequate number of participants to initially include in our study, and (2) the average effect size of our intervention, which would have been necessary to compute power analyses before the start of the study.\nThe high dropout rate in the LKM group dramatically reduced the number of observations and, therefore, considerably reduced the power of analyses including all three groups. Under these conditions, it seems hardly possible to highlight results on the PER group, even though the visual analysis of the change scores (see Fig 1) suggests that some interesting results do exist.\nSince the power problems were mainly related to the LKM group, and since our main group of interest was the PER group, we decided to leave the question of LKM efficacy aside, so as to focus on our main question of interest: the efficacy of the PER program. Analyzing those results independently of the LKM seemed to constitute the most relevant option (from both a clinical and statistical point of view) to quantify the effects of the PER intervention, if they exist. In the following pages, we will present the results of analyses comparing the PER and control groups only. The means and standard deviations for each variable at each time point in the PER program and in the control group are shown in Table 3.\nRepeated measures ANOVAs were performed on each measure, with group (PER program, control) as a between-subjects factor, and time (T1, T2) as a within-subjects factor. In each case, we were looking for a significant Time x Group interaction, which would indicate a differential change between the two groups. Analyses confirmed a highly significant group interaction for four of the five scales: SHS, F(1, 59) = 5.52, p<.022, η2partial = .09; SWLS, F(1, 60) = 4.20, p<.045, η2partial = .07; BDI, F(1, 60) = 4.50, p<.038, η2partial = .07; and PILL, F(1,59) = 5.86, p<.021, η2partial = .09. Results for PSS did not reach significance (F(1, 59) = 2.99, p = .089, η2partial = .05).\nAs depicted in Table 3, the breakdown of these interactions revealed that, unlike participants in the control group, who did not show any change on any variable under study between T1 and T2, participants in the PER group showed a significant increase in subjective happiness (SHS), t (26) = −2.94, p>.007, d = .50, and satisfaction with life (SWLS), t (27) = −2.88, p<.008, d = .51. They also showed a significant decrease in depression (BDI), t (27) = 2.73, p<.011, d = .61 and physical symptoms (PILL), t (26) = 3.30, p<.003, d = .51 and a marginal decrease in perceived stress (PSS), t (27) = 1.97, p = .059, d = .38 (see Table 3).\n\n\nDiscussionThe objective of our study was twofold: (1) to construct a theory- and evidence-based integrative intervention aimed at increasing well-being and (2) to test its effectiveness on participants' mental and physical well-being. Based on the Process Model of Positive Emotion Regulation [28], [29], we developed a 12 hour (6 × 2 hr) integrative training program, bringing together a series of theory-based and empirically-validated techniques. The theoretical framework allowed us to organize these different well-being enhancing techniques and to deliver them in a coherent format. In addition, this framework made it possible to integrate techniques using different underlying processes (or strategies).\nIn accordance with our hypothesis, our results indicate that, compared to an inactive control group, the PER group showed a significant increase in subjective happiness and satisfaction with life and a significant decrease in depression symptoms and somatic complaints. There was also a marginal decrease in perceived stress. These results confirm that it is possible to enhance an individual's psychological and physical well-being and that the PER program that we developed is a valid intervention to achieve this goal.\nAnother interesting finding of our study concerns loving-kindness meditation. In our study, the LKM dropout rate (43%) suggests that, although LKM seems to work for those who follow the program until the end, a significant proportion of participants do not adhere to this intervention. It is worth noting that the high dropout rate in the LKM condition is consistent with results reported by Carson et al. [78]. The latter study tested the effects of LKM among chronic pain sufferers and also showed a 42% dropout rate (13 out of 31 subjects) in its LKM group. However, individuals who fully adhered to the intervention until the end of the program benefited from it, as evinced by better psychological adjustment to pain. Several hypotheses can be put forward in order to explain the high dropout in our study. First, participants who enrolled in our program had no precise idea of the type of techniques they were going to learn, unlike in Fredrickson et al.'s [65] well-known LKM study, where participants enrolled in a “meditation program.” It is therefore possible that some of them were surprised by the proposed method and found that it did not suit them, which may have caused them to drop out of the intervention. The majority of the qualitative feedback received from participants who quitted the LKM condition mentions an incongruity between the proposed technique and their personality (e.g. “I am too impatient for this type of exercise,” “Meditation stresses me, I am not comfortable with this type of method,” “If I had known that we were going to meditate, I would not have signed up”). Second, another explanation that may explain the high dropout rate in the LKM group concerns the trainers [79]. As pointed by an anonymous reviewer, the large number of dropouts could have been because some participants did not enjoy the personality of the trainer and/or the type of group dynamic he proposed. In order to reduce the risk of having such a trainer effect, we recruited two LKM trainers. Results indicate that the observed dropout was independent of the trainer identity. For this reason, we believe that this second hypothesis is less plausible.\nOverall, our results and previous literature suggest that LKM can be an effective technique to increase the well-being of individuals who adhere to the program. Our results also show that the PER program is an effective alternative that may be more readily accepted by the majority of individuals. Previous LKM results (e.g. [65], [78]) suggest that it may be interesting to include elements of LKM within an integrative intervention such as the PER program, or to recommend this technique to individuals for whom this type of intervention appears to be the most clinically relevant (e.g. people open to meditative practices).\nIn addition to bringing a theoretical reflection about the processes underlying happiness enhancing techniques, this article aimed to provide practical information to practitioners desiring to use an integrative and theory-driven intervention to boost their clients' well-being. This is why we have described the PER program that we developed based on Quoidbach et al.'s theoretical model [28], [29] in greater detail than usually found in empirical articles. Like one anonymous reviewer, one may wonder whether the underlying theoretical model must be described to the participants. Based on our experience and on participants' qualitative comments at the end of the sessions, we think that it should definitely be explained to them. First, several times during the training, we invite participants to choose the exercises they wish to practice from a selection that we offer (for their weekly homework and long-term exercises after the end of the program). However, the techniques that individuals prefer are not always those that are best for them [69], [80]. Explaining the model to the participants therefore seems important, so as to show them the variety of techniques available and to encourage them to try at least one technique from each type of strategy (or model section) in order to discover new methods to enhance their happiness level. Second, some of our participants reported that the classification of strategies made them aware that they always use the same family of strategies and rarely any of the others. For instance, one participant realized that he often interprets events positively (cognitive level), but that he is systematically incapable of being fully present during the pleasant moments he experiences (attentional level). Other participants reported similar realizations about techniques usable before, during or after an event. One young woman clearly identified that she is able to feel a lot of positive emotions about past events, but that she almost never plans future events in order to get the most out of them. Thus, the model increases participants' awareness of their functioning and provides them with new ways to increase their well-being. We therefore encourage trainers who would like to teach the PER program to present and explain the model to their groups.\nIn individual therapy, Quoidbach et al.'s model [28], [29] could also be used to identify strategies that a happiness seeker has not been using, and thereby the type of exercise(s) that could be prescribed. However, further research should be conducted to better understand which strategies are the most beneficial for specific profiles of individuals. Pending the development of individually tailored happiness enhancing interventions (see [57], [81] for examples of “tailored interventions” attempts), integrative programs such as the PER program offer the greatest probability of being effective for the widest range of individuals.\nAlthough this study offers promising prospects, we acknowledge several limitations that leave ample room for future research to refine our findings. The first limitation concerns the missing data in the LKM condition due to the large dropout rate that we had not expected. The number of missing data in this group strongly decreased the statistical power to a point where we did not have sufficient power to demonstrate effects, even if they existed. Now that we have information about the potential dropout rate in the LKM condition, we could run this study again, but this time calculate the appropriate number of participants to include in the groups in order to have a satisfying remaining power at the end of the study, even if a large portion of participants were to fail to complete the intervention.The second limitation concerns the timing of the assessments. Our post-intervention measure was carried out only once, four weeks after the end of the intervention. Although most of the literature about happiness enhancing strategies includes T2 assessment right after the end of the last exercise, we chose to collect that information four weeks after the end of our intervention because it seemed methodologically more appropriate to measure the remaining impact of our intervention in individuals' real life. Indeed, right after the intervention, people are still fully impregnated with it, while a few weeks later, they have returned to their life, without any reminder of the techniques proposed within the intervention. Although this timing difference diminishes our ability to compare our results to those obtained with other techniques presented in the literature, the fact that we found results four weeks after the end of our intervention shows that it continues to exert its effects after the end of the intervention. It would have been ideal, of course, to follow participants over a longer period of time to be able to do more sophisticated statistical analyses and to see if the benefits maintain in the long term, after six months or one year. Unfortunately, most of our participants were in their last year at university and left the department a few months after the end of the intervention, which led their student email address to be disabled. We lost contact with most of them right after this T2 measurement.A third potential limitation of our study concerns the composition of our sample. On the one hand, all the participants in our study were young adults, and as a consequence, our results may not be generalizable to the entire population. However, findings from the meta-analysis carried out by Sin and Lyubomirsky [23] indicate that the benefits of positive psychology interventions tend to increase with age. This observation therefore leads us to speculate that testing our intervention on a “young” sample probably resulted in an underestimation, rather than an overestimation, of its effects. On the other hand, our experimental groups were composed of a very limited number of men (PER, N = 4; LKM, N = 3), and this prevented us from investigating a potential impact of gender on the effectiveness of the intervention. It is therefore risky to affirm that our results can be generalized regardless of participant gender. Nevertheless, existing literature in this field has shown no systematic influence of gender on the effectiveness of happiness enhancing techniques, a fact that increases our confidence in the predictive validity of our results for both sexes.Using only self-reported measures is a fourth limitation of our study. Although numerous authors insist that using self-evaluation is a sensible logical way to evaluate a subjective experience such as well-being [82], we consider that it is necessary to complement these measures with objective health indicators (such as cortisol level [83]), 360 degree assessments (e.g. ratings of one's happiness by friends, partner; frequent verbal expression of positive emotions, [84]) or experience sampling methods [85] in future studies. This kind of measure should decrease the risk of social desirability effects linked to the use of self-report measures and increase the reliability and objectivity of the findings.As pointed by an anonymous reviewer, future research would benefit from comparing our PER group to existing integrative interventions such as Seligman et al.'s Group Positive Psychotherapy [27]. This would allow determining more precisely the efficiency of our training compared to other integrative intervention and the added value of the theoretical model that underlies it.Finally, despite the fact that we present an integrative intervention, we acknowledge that studies that focus on specific techniques are critically important. In addition to enabling the evaluation of the unique effect of a particular technique, these studies are crucial in determining the strategies that are particularly beneficial or harmful for specific sub-populations (e.g. highly depressed people, young adults VS people in the final stage of life, individuals from different cultures) and they help understand the processes underlying the effectiveness of a given technique."

                "Background: The training to become a dentist can create psychological distress. The present study evaluates the structure of the ‘Perceived Stress Questionnaire’ (PSQ), its internal consistency model and interrelatedness with burnout, anxiety, depression and resilience among dental students. Methods: The study employed a cross-sectional design. A sample of Spanish dental students (n = 314) completed the PSQ, the ‘Goldberg Anxiety and Depression Scale’ (GADS), ‘Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale’ (10-item CD-RISC) and ‘Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey’ (MBI-SS). The structure was estimated using Parallel Analysis from polychoric correlations. Unweighted Least Squares was the method for factor extraction, using the Item Response Theory to evaluate the discriminative power of items. Internal consistency was assessed by squaring the correlation between the latent true variable and the observed variable. The relationships between the PSQ and the other constructs were analysed using Spearman’s coefficient. Results: The results showed a PSQ structure through two sub-factors (‘frustration’ and ‘tenseness’) with regard to one general factor (‘perceived stress’). Items that did not satisfy discriminative capacity were rejected. The model fit were acceptable (GFI = 0.98; RSMR = 0.06; AGFI = 0.98; NFI = 0.98; RFI = 0.98). All the factors showed adequate internal consistency as measured by the congeneric model (≥0.91). High and significant associations were observed between perceived stress and burnout, anxiety, depression and resilience. Conclusions: The PSQ showed a hierarchical bi-factor structure among Spanish dental students. Using the questionnaire as a uni-dimensional scale may be useful in perceived stress level discrimination, while the sub-factors could help us to refine perceived stress analysis and improve therapeutic processes.

            "fulltext": "IntroductionThe training to become a health professional can create psychological distress and symptoms of burnout, which may have adverse consequences for one’s personal and professional life [1]–[5]. Dentists experience high levels of work-related stress, which begins during professional training [6]. Furthermore, the prevalence of burnout among dentistry students is high, with a significant relation found between the syndrome and a student’s academic performance, use of medication and thoughts of dropping out of the course [6]. Dental students complain of exhaustion resulting from the high levels of anxiety generated by exams, limited free time available for relaxation and the stress associated with having to adapt to the requirements of clinical practice [7]–[9]. As a result, some new dentistry graduates exhibit alarmingly high levels of burnout [10].\n‘Stress’ occurs when environmental demands overwhelm individuals’ resources and threaten their personal well-being. It has been defined as the result of a relationship with the environment that individuals appraise as significant for their well-being and in which the demands exceed the available coping resources [11]. ‘Burnout’ is a response to the failure to cope adequately with chronic occupational stress and is an attempt to adapt to or to protect oneself from it [12]. This syndrome has classically been characterized by a state of exhaustion, cynicism and inefficacy [13]. ‘Exhaustion’ is the feeling of not being able to offer any more of oneself; ‘cynicism’ represents a distant attitude towards work, those served by it and other colleagues; and ‘inefficacy’ is the feeling of not performing tasks adequately or being incompetent.\nOn the other hand, ‘resilience’ has been characterized as a dynamic and flexible process of adaptation to life changes that could serve as a protective factor against psychological distress and mental disorders [14], [15]. It is the amount of personal strength, energy and motivation that enables an individual to cope with and recover from stress and to flourish when faced with adversity. Most of the proposed models to improve well-being in students and health professionals aim to enhance strategies for coping with stress using educational and environmental support as well as cognitive exercises that strengthen resilience skills [16], [17].\nFrom the early stages of their university studies, dental students show concern for the stress produced by their experiences with clinical practice. They develop intense and long-term interactions with clients and patients, which is characteristic of careers with high levels of psychological distress and burnout [18]. Experiencing burnout over a prolonged period is associated with adverse emotional consequences, such as anxiety and depression, and it can also negatively affect the quality of patient care [19]–[24]. As a result, being able to measure the stress process in dental students seems to be essential if we want to evaluate their well-being along with their period of professional training.\nThe ‘Perceived Stress Questionnaire’ (PSQ) is a 30-item instrument that was developed by clinicians to quantify perceived stress [25]. It is one of the most used instruments that measure the stress process in psychosomatic research and has been associated with somatic complaints. In addition, it has demonstrated good predictive values in stress-related diseases [26]–[28]. The PSQ permits the subjective experience of perceived stressful situations and stress reactions to be assessed, emphasizing cognitive perceptions more than emotional states or specific life events. The general form of the instruction asks questions related to ‘the last two years’ and the recent form asks about situations taking place ‘during the last month’, potentially addressing chronic and acute relationships with stressful events and activities. It contains both positively and negatively formulated items in order to reduce acquiescent bias. Each item is answered using a four-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (‘almost never’) to 4 (‘almost always’). Higher scores indicate more severe perceived stress. Originally designed in English, this instrument has been translated to Italian, German and Spanish, and validated in populations of psychiatric inpatients and outpatients, nursing students, health workers, psychosomatic patients and health adults [25], [27], [28].\nOne key element of this questionnaire is that it includes different groups of stressful experiences, such as harassment, overload, irritability, lack of joy, fatigue, worries and tension, which were proposed in its original version. However, this structure was not replicated. The study by Sanz-Carrillo [27] revealed the dimensions of social acceptance, load, irritability, energy, fear and self-realization; while the Fliege’s study [28] observed worries, tension, lack of joy and demands, differentiating the first three as internal stress reactions, while demands was classified as external stressors. So far, contemplating a general factor seems to be the most reasonable solution for its use. The original author proposed a linear algorithm ranging from 0 to 1 [25].\nThe previous inconsistencies may be due to differences among the samples that were used, which is in line with the idea that validating instruments in a specific population of interest is the most advisable option [29]. Nevertheless, the principal component analysis used as factor extraction method from r correlation matrices, along with the Kaiser role for the number of factors to retain, do not seem to be the best option to estimate factorial models using psychological variables as mentioned, and they are too often used out of force of habit [30].\nTherefore, the goals of the present study were to evaluate the factor structure of the PSQ with dental students, together with its internal consistency model and its interrelatedness with the constructs of burnout, anxiety, depression and resilience. As a hypothesis, we expected high and significant correlations between all constructs.\nMethods\nStudy Design\nWe used a cross-sectional design by means of the application of a self-assessment survey.\n\n\nSetting, Sample and Ethics Statement\nThe population consisted of Spanish dental students enrolled in Huesca (NH = 136) and Santiago de Compostela (NS = 242), during the 2010–11 academic year. An 83.1% response rate (RR) to the surveys, which were sent to all prospective participants, resulted in a sample of n = 314 participants. The students did not receive any financial or credit compensation for participating in the study. No differences were found in RR based on sex (males = 81.4% vs. females = 83.8%; p = 0.576), campus (Huesca = 87.5% vs. Santiago de Compostela = 80.6%; p = 0.085) or age (participants Mn = 22.05; SD = 3.57 vs. non-participants Mn = 22.34; SD = 3.83; p = 0.551).\nA clinical psychologist trained two research assistants to administer the questionnaires as a battery in a paper-and-pencil format. The first page of the protocol identified the objectives of the study, participants, potential benefits and risks and the confidentiality of the data treatment. Each participant provided written informed consent before the commencement of the survey. The research assistants administered the survey in May 2011, two weeks before the period of final exams. After completion, the questionnaires were collected and kept in a sealed envelope to ensure the participants’ anonymity. The Ethical Review Board of Aragon, Spain, approved the study protocol. This study followed Helsinki Convention norms and later modifications, the Declaration of Madrid of the World Psychiatric Association and the Uniform Requirements for manuscripts submitted to Bio-medical journals.\n\n\nMeasures\nSocio-demographics.Data were collected on age, gender, stable relationship (‘yes’, ‘no’), children (‘yes’, ‘no’), campus (‘Huesca’, ‘Santiago’), distance from family home (km), residence (‘with parents’, ‘dormitory’, ‘shared flat’, ‘private flat’), scholarship (‘yes’, ‘no’), parental support perceived (‘insufficient’, ‘good’, ‘very good’), weekly study hours, failed subjects over the previous period (‘none’, ‘one’, ‘two or more’), job (‘yes’, ‘no’) and year of study (‘first’, ‘second’, ‘third’, ‘fourth’, ‘fifth’).\n\nPerceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ).The Spanish version of PSQ (described above) was used, specifically its “recent form” addressing the previous 30 days [25], [27].\n\nGoldberg Anxiety and Depression Scale (GADS).The participants completed the Spanish version of the GADS [31], [32], which consists of a 9-item subscale that assesses symptoms of anxiety and a 9-item subscale that assesses symptoms of depression. The participants respond with either ‘yes’ or ‘no’, with one point scored for each positive response. A greater number of positive responses is associated with a greater likelihood of suffering from anxiety or depression. Each subscale provides a measure of the associated mental disorder. The convergence validity of the GADS has demonstrated adequate values of sensitivity and specificity [32]–[34]. We used this short and friendly scale because it is recommended for the screening of anxiety and depression in large sample studies in the general population [31]–[32].\n\nConnor-Davidson Resilience Scale (10-item CD-RISC).The participants also completed the Spanish version of the 10-item CD-RISC [35]–[36]. This scale is a self-report instrument that measures resilience on a 5-point Likert scale with responses that range from 0 (‘not at all’) to 4 (‘almost always’). The final scores are obtained by summing the response to each of the items, with higher values indicating higher levels of resilience. The validity and internal consistency of the scale were adequate and positively related to variables such as sleep quality and mental health [35], [36].\n\nMaslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey (MBI-SS).Subjects were given the MBI-SS in its validated Spanish version for students [13], [37]. This questionnaire is the ‘golden rule’ for the evaluation of burnout, and this adaptation consists of 15 items grouped into the three dimensions: five items corresponded to exhaustion, four to cynicism and six to efficacy. Responses are arranged in a 7-point Likert scale, scored from 0 (‘never’) to 6 (‘always’). The scores of each dimension are obtained by adding up the responses to the corresponding items, with higher values indicating higher levels of each one. The questionnaire dimensions present an adequate structure and internal consistency [37].\n\n\n\nData Analysis\nSPSS v19.0, FACTOR v9.02 and AMOS v7.0 statistical packages were used to conduct the analysis.\nDescriptives.Means, standard deviations, skewness, kurtosis and Mardia’s coefficients [38] were calculated to evaluate the performance of the PSQ items.\n\nDimensionality.Polychoric correlation is advised for factorial analysis (FA) when the distributions of ordinal items are asymmetric, with excess of kurtosis or with high item-rest coefficients [39]. Thus, a polychoric correlation matrix was estimated with regard to the PSQ items. We used parallel analysis (PA) [40] to identify the number of factors to include in the factorial solution, by replacing the raw data method [41] with optimal implementation based on minimum rank factor analysis [42], generating 500 random correlation matrices from permutation of the raw data. With this analysis, a factor is considered significant if the associated eigen-value is greater than that corresponding to 95th percentile of the distribution of eigen-values derived from a random dataset. PA is considered the best available solution to decide the number-of-factors-to-retain [43], [44]. We had previously verified the adequacy of the matrix, assessing the determinant, the KMO index and Barlett’s test of sphericity [45].\nUnweighted Least Squares (ULS) was the method used for factor extraction [46]. The ULS procedure does not provide inferential estimations for assessing model data fit based on the χ2 distribution, but it has important advantages: it does not require any distributional assumptions; it is quite robust and usually converges because of its efficiency in terms of computation; and it tends to provide less biased estimates of the true parameter values [47]. Additionally, ULS is an appropriate choice for the case of not excessively large samples and shows good performance when working with polychoric matrices. In fact, ULS is consistent with the underlying variables approach from the Item Response Theory (IRT); it tends to supply accurate estimates even when models are large; and it provides better estimates than far more complex procedures [48]–[50]. The rotation method used was Promax, with a parameter of k = 4.00, given the correlated solution expected and using Raw Varimax as clever rotation start. We used Bentler’s simplicity index (S) and the loading simplicity index (LS) to evaluate factorial simplicity [51], [52].\nAlthough we used unrestricted item factor analysis at this stage, we actually propose a second order factor solution, as a perceived stress general factor (G), by hierarchical factor solution [53]. This specification, which is multidimensional but is able to reflect the essential uni-dimensionality of the data, prescribes a factor which reflects what is common to all of the items, working as a multidimensional semi-confirmatory factorial analysis [54]. The factor weights (w) and the % of variance explained in each item by means of communality values (h2) were calculated. IRT parameterization by multidimensional normal-ogive graded response model (derived from the assumption of normally distributed measurement error), showed us the pattern of item discriminations in each dimension [55]. The belonging factor was determined by means of the IRT discrimination (an), with those items with poor values being dismissed. Specifically, those items with an values <0.65 were discarded, as well as those with an values >0.65 in all of the latent dimensions at the same time [56].\nWe examined the fit of the proposed PSQ model by CFA, applying ULS from a polychoric matrix, for the reasons stated above. From a general perspective, we used the goodness-of-fit index (GFI), the adjusted goodness-of-fit index (AGFI), the root mean square of the standardized residuals (RMSR), the normed-fit-index (NFI) and Bollen’s relative-fit-index (RFI). GFI and AGFI refer to explained variance and values >0.90 are considered acceptable [57]. SRMR is the standardized difference between the observed and the predicted covariance, indicating a good fit for values <0.08 [58]. NFI measures the proportional reduction in the adjustment function when going from null to the proposed model and is considered acceptable when >0.90 [59]. RFI takes into account the discrepancy for the model evaluated and for the baseline model, and it is very good close to 1 [60]. All of them are perfectly valid for the ULS procedure. Taken together, they provide a reliable evaluation of the solution and additional information regarding absolute and incremental model fit. From an analytical perspective, standardized factor saturations and the explained variance were also considered.\n\nReliability.We examined the internal consistency of the scales and sub-escales using congeneric, tau-equivalent and parallel models [61]. The congeneric model is the least restrictive and assumes that each individual item measures the same latent variable, with possibly different scales, degrees of precision and magnitude of error. The tau-equivalent model implies that individual items measure the same latent variable on the same scale and with the same degree of precision, but with possibly different degrees of error. The parallel model is the most restrictive measurement model; it assumes that all items must measure the same latent variable on the same scale, with the same degree of precision and with the same amount of error. We finally chose the model that fitted better with the data, applying the ULS method and establishing comparisons. The reliability value was estimated by squaring the implied correlation between the composite latent true variable and the composite observed variable, to arrive at the percentage of the total observed variance that was accounted for by the true variable [62]. Mean inter-item polychoric correlations, item-rest and mean item-rest correlations were also used, as well as the mean Spearman’s R coefficients between the items over the belonging factor, calculated according to the Bayes ‘Expected A Posteriori’ (EAP) [63].\n\nConvergence.Participant’s scores on PSQ factors calculated by EAP were also used in order to evaluate the degree of association between them and regarding the other constructs by means of Spearman’s R coefficients.\n\n\nResultsIn order to adhere to standards for data availability, the authors state that all materials used to produce the results in this paper will be made available upon request. This includes [64]: 1.- The list of documents and data files that are needed in order for replication to be possible, 2.- A detailed list of what will be provided by the authors, and 3.- What steps, and in what sequence, the interested researchers need to take in order for this data to be made available. In addition, authors will post these materials on the group’s website [65].\n\nParticipants\nTable 1 displays the general characteristics of participants. They comprised adults of European ethnicity between the ages of 18 and 41 (Mn = 22.05; SD = 3.57), 70.70% of whom were women. Compared to students in Santiago de Compostela, students in Huesca lived further away from the family home (χ2 = 72.53; df = 2; p<0.001), were more likely to live in shared flats (χ2 = 14.79; df = 3; p = 0.002), were less likely to have received a scholarship (χ2 = 6.66; df = 1; p = 0.010) and failed a higher percentage of subjects over the previous exam period (χ2 = 7.33; df = 2; p = 0.026). Students in both Santiago and Huesca were similar with regard to the rest of the socio-demographic and occupational variables.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 1.

Some items presented skewness values >1.00, such as ‘you feel lonely or isolated’ (item n° 5) and ‘you find yourself in situations of conflict’ (n° 6). Otherwise, some items showed kurtosis values <−1.00, as ‘you feel calm’ (n° 10 reversed), ‘you are under pressure from other people’ (n° 19), ‘you are afraid for the future’ (n° 22) and ‘you feel under pressure from deadlines’ (item n° 30). Mardia’s multivariate skewness and kurtosis coefficients were 132.70 (p = 1.00) and 1,040.71 (p<0.001), respectively.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 2.  Descriptives, factorial solution, communalities and IRT parameterization of the PSQ items.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0087071.t002\n\nDimensionality\nThe polychoric matrix of the PSQ items revealed that 78.6% of coefficients out of the diagonal were ≥0.30. The determinant was <0.001. KMO test had a value of 0.95 and Bartlett’s statistic was 4,780.50 (df = 435; p<0.001). The PA identified a two-factor structure, explaining 54.9% of the variance [(λ1 = 12.23; 46.7% variance of the real data; 7.5% variance explained over the P95 of the random samples); (λ2 = 2.39; 8.2% variance of the real data; 6.9% variance explained over the P95 of the random samples)]. The hierarchical solution by two first order factors (F1 and F2) and one second-order factor (G) exhibited good simplicity indices, such as S = 0.98 (P99) and LS = 0.45 (P99).\nTable 2 shows the weights over G, the rotated loading matrix over F1 and F2 and the h2 values. All the items loaded ≥0.40 in G, except ‘you feel you are doing things you really like’ (n° 7 reversed; wg = 0.27). F1 presented topics related to ‘frustration’, such as ‘you are light-hearted’ (n° 25 reversed; w1 = 0.94), ‘you feel discouraged’ (n° 20; w1 = 0.82) or ‘you feel frustrated’ (n° 12; w1 = 0.72). F2 exhibited themes associated with ‘tenseness’, such as ‘you have too many things to do’ (n° 4; w2 = 0.95), ‘you feel that too many demands are being made on you’ (n° 2; w2 = 0.83), or ‘you feel you are in a hurry’ (n° 16; w2 = 0.82). In general, h2 values were high, with an average of 0.49. Table 2 shows the PSQ items in terms of IRT discrimination. Some items did not present sufficient values, such as ‘you feel rested’ (n° 1 reversed; a1 = 0.11; a2 = 0.58), ‘you are irritable or grouchy’ (n° 3; a1 = 0.52; a2 = 0.56), and also items n° 6 (a1 = 0.50; a2 = 0.08), n° 19 (a1 = 0.52; a2 = 0.50) and n° 22 (a1 = 0.43; a2 = 0.11), already mentioned. Additionally, ‘your problems seem to be piling up’ (n° 15; a1 = 0.73; a2 = 0.79) presented high values in both factors, so it was also dismissed.\nFigure 1 shows the PSQ hierarchical bi-factor structure using CFA from an analytical and standardized point of view. The two first order factors turned out to be highly influenced by G, with loadings over F1 = 0.96 and F2 = 0.82. The item loadings with regard to their respective latent factor were high (F1 and F2 ranges  = 0.42 to 0.81 and  = 0.38 to 0.85, respectively). In a general sense, the PSQ hierarchical bi-factor structure presented adequate fit indices without using correlations between the error terms (GFI = 0.98; RSMR = 0.06; AGFI = 0.98; NFI = 0.98; RFI = 0.98).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.

Convergence values for the PSQ hierarchical bi-factor structure.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0087071.t004\nDespite the fact that perceived stress has been evaluated among dental students [9], as far as we are aware, this is the first factorial study of the PSQ among dental students. It is also the first study to examine its internal consistency model as well as possible interrelatedness with burnout, anxiety, depression and resilience. Other studies have evaluated its structure in other samples [27], [28], but the methods used did not respect the true ordinal nature of the variables, as we have. Our results provide evidence of a clear two-factor structure of the PSQ in dental students (‘frustration’ and ‘tenseness’), while it was also possible to use a single general factor (‘perceived stress’). Overall, the questionnaire had good psychometric properties, with adequate reliability and good convergence values, although it was advisable to discard some non-discriminative items. We found that the congeneric model was the optimal model to measure its internal consistency. Interestingly, the results revealed different relationship patterns between the perceived stress factors and the other constructs.The main strength of the present study is that generalizability was enhanced because it was conducted using an high-stress-risk sample [4], [7]–[9], from two different universities in two Spanish regions, and these groups exhibited similar response rate. It is interesting to highlight the fact that the study was carried out during the period of final exams, a well-known source of distress, which may make the results more relevant [66]. The response rate was high and the participants did not differ significantly from non-participants with regard to age, gender or years of study. Moreover, an independent researcher supervised the data transcription process to control for errors, and the analysis method respected the true nature of the variables used. The main limitation of the study was the use of a cross-sectional design because it did not permit the analysis of causal hypotheses. Another limitation could proceed from the instruments used, because they are not the only questionnaires used to measure such constructs. The use of other questionnaires might have produced slightly different results.The participants in the study were young adults. Most of the individuals were women who did not have children. The majority of students also did not receive financial assistance and were not employed. On average, the responses of the participants were not extreme, although the values for tenseness and anxiety were moderately high. Comparatively, the scores for frustration, burnout and depression were slightly lower. This findings can be understood by considering the pressure that the students experienced owing to the proximity of final exams.One of the most salient findings of this study is the clear hierarchical bi-factor structure shown by the PSQ among Spanish dental students. In this population, high correlations were observed between one second-order factor and two first-order factors. The second order factor (G) refers to ‘perceived stress’ as a general factor, as used in the original proposal [25], [26] and in other studies [27], [28]. The first of the first-order factors (F1), which we referred to as ‘frustration’, mainly included items from the original ‘lack of joy’ and ‘worries’. The second of the first-order factors (F2), named ‘tenseness’, mainly included items from the original ‘tension’ and ‘overload’ [25]. In other words, F1 consisted of the stress perceived as lack of joy and worries, and F2 consisted of the external stressor of demands and the stress reaction of tension [28].In general terms, the behaviour of the items was adequate, with high and positive item-rest values, although their distributions suggest a non-linear analysis, as was expected. All the items weighted strongly and positively in G factor. However, the IRT discrimination values advised us to reject some items because they were unable to differentiate adequately between F1 and F2. For these reasons, the 24 selected items were strong and positively weighted in the belonging factor and the model fit was very good. These items correlated highly with one another and internal consistency values were high, for G as well as for F1 and F2. Each item seemed to be measuring the corresponding latent variables, with possibly different degrees of precision and different amounts of error.We found that G was significantly related to all the considered constructs, and therefore this finding supports the hypothesis that burnout syndrome could mediate the link between perceived stress and the occurrence of emotional disorders [67], [68], although it is well known that there are many others sources of stress, different from those related to work or workers in training. In other words, occupational stress could be an important risk factor for the development of anxious and depressive symptoms in dental students through burnout syndrome [69]–[71]. Thus, dealing with stress problems at an early stage of training may help to promote resilience and reduce burnout and mental health problems in the longer term [72]. Nevertheless, in order to reach a full understanding of the process, it will be necessary to continue with research until the hypothetical relationships put forward can be fully brought to light. It will be necessary to make use of designs that allow possible causal relationships to be explained, particularly if we are interested in developing effective lines of intervention, given the lack of these in a setting that is so in need of them.In addition, the pattern of relationships observed between the PSQ first-order factors and the other constructs suggests that while both F1 and F2 seems to be strongly associated with exhaustion, anxiety and depression, F1 could be more positively related than F2 to cynicism, and more negatively related to efficacy and resilience. In general, resilience increases the feelings of satisfaction and commitment that promote the empowerment of and beneficial outcomes for students and even workers [73]–[77]. In accordance with the demands-resources model [78], people who suffer from burnout experience a progressive decline in commitment to their studies over time [79]. This is perhaps why resilience constitutes a coping reservoir that influences the long term functioning of university students [17,72). However, our results suggest that interventions focused on promoting resilience may be of benefit in overcoming frustration more than tenseness, while tenseness seems to be more important in this population. Combining resilience interventions with relaxation interventions could possibly be the best choice for dental students."

                "\n        Pictorial health warnings on cigarette packs create aversive emotional reactions to smoking and induce thoughts about quitting; however, contrary to models of health behavior change, they do not appear to alter intentions to quit smoking. We propose and test a novel model of intention to quit an addictive habit such as smoking (the efficacy-desire model) that can explain this paradoxical effect. At the core of the model is the prediction that self-efficacy and desire to quit an addictive habit are inversely related. We tested the model in an online experiment that randomly exposed smokers (N = 3297) to a cigarette pack with one of three increasing levels of warning intensity. The results supported the model’s prediction that despite the effects of warnings on aversion to smoking, intention to quit smoking is an inverted U-shape function of the smoker’s self-efficacy for quitting. In addition, smokers with greater (lesser) quit efficacy relative to smoking efficacy increase (decrease) intentions to quit. The findings show that previous failures to observe effects of pictorial warning labels on quit intentions can be explained by the contradictory individual differences that warnings produce. Thus, the model explains the paradoxical finding that quit intentions do not change at the population level, even though smokers recognize the implications of warnings. The model suggests that pictorial warnings are effective for smokers with stronger quit-efficacy beliefs and provides guidance for how cigarette warnings and tobacco control strategies can be designed to help smokers quit.\n      "

            "fulltext": "IntroductionCigarette smoking accounts for over 430,000 deaths annually in the U.S. [1] and is responsible for over 5 million fatalities per year worldwide [2]. Efforts to educate the public about the hazards of smoking have been ongoing since they were first identified [3]. These efforts along with restrictions on advertising and locations where people can smoke have steadily reduced the prevalence of smoking in the U.S. from a high of 42% in 1965 to about 20% in most recent surveys [4]. In addition, rates of initiation in adolescents have declined, thereby reducing the recruitment of new smokers to the population [4], [5]. Despite these successes, the rate of quitting smoking in recent years has declined and, although many try to quit, only about 5% are successful annually [6]. As a result of this and a growing population, there are almost as many smokers in the U.S. today as there were at the height of the epidemic in the 1960’s. Clearly, in order to continue reducing smoking prevalence, greater efforts will be needed to reach smokers who fail to quit.\nOne effort by the U. S. government to encourage quitting has been to place textual warnings about the hazards of smoking on the sides of cigarette packs. Although such warnings have been in place in the U.S. since 1965, they have not changed since 1984 and are easy to ignore [7], [8]. In an effort to increase the effectiveness of these warnings, recent legislation empowers the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to impose larger pictorial warnings on the front and back of cigarette packs similar to those that were first introduced in Canada and elsewhere. Research indicates that these enhanced warnings not only draw the smoker’s attention but also succeed in creating aversive emotional reactions to the prospect of smoking [9], [10]. In addition, studies of the effects of introducing pictorial warnings in Australia and the UK indicate that they increase smokers’ thoughts about quitting [11], [12].\nThese findings have led researchers and policy makers to conclude that the warnings work, despite the lack of direct evidence that they increase quit rates [9]. Indeed, research conducted to evaluate immediate effects of pictorial warnings in the U.S. indicates that the warnings seldom change intentions to quit [13], [14]. A large FDA test of 36 different pictorial warning labels presented to two age groups of smokers (18–24 vs. 25+) revealed that out of 72 tests, only 6 increased intentions to try to quit [13]. A smaller replication with fewer warnings but larger sample sizes per condition found that, although pictorial warnings enhanced smokers’ aversion to smoking, they produced no overall effects on intentions to try to quit in the near future [14].\nIntentions are important because they are critical precursors to behavior change [15]. Unless a smoker strongly intends to quit, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to overcome the cravings and withdrawal symptoms that maintain this addictive habit [16]. Indeed, models of health behavior change, such as Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) [17], the Health Belief Model (HBM) [18], and the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) [15], predict that intentions should increase as the perceived risks of smoking increase. Nevertheless, although pictorial warnings encourage smokers to think about quitting, the warnings do not appear to enhance the likelihood that the average smoker will actually try to quit. Thus, the failure of warnings to influence intentions poses a paradox for any theory that assumes that people act in their own best interests, especially when they recognize threats to those interests.\nRecent neuroscience research provides insight into the paradoxical effects of warning labels. This research has identified two neuropsychological systems that influence the development of an addiction and that explain why smoking cessation is difficult. First, ingestion of nicotine, the addictive drug in tobacco, alters the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system that controls expectations of reward [19]. Over time, these expectations become conditioned to the act of smoking itself, thus making the person who smokes sensitive to any cues associated with the act and enhancing the desire to smoke when exposed to them [20], [21]. Second, repeated acts of smoking transfer control over the habit to dorsal striatal circuits that undermine prefrontal control [22], [23] and that turn the habit into a compulsion, leaving the smoker with reduced sense of control over the behavior [24], [25]. Although this description of the two systems is necessarily abbreviated, it is clear that these changes in the reward and control systems make it difficult for the addict to resist the pull of smoking cues and the craving elicited by them. Thus, despite the desire to quit that most smokers report [26], their perceived efficacy to do so is lacking. This conflict between desire and efficacy often leaves smokers without sufficient motivation and, hence, intention to quit the habit.\nIn view of the powerful neuropsychological processes identified by neuroscience research, we translated those insights into a behavioral decision making model that can account for the paradoxical finding that despite enhancing desires to quit, warnings do not appear to change intentions to do so. We first describe the model and then present a test of its major predictions.\n\nA Model of Intentions to Quit an Addictive Behavior such as Smoking\nThe efficacy-desire model (EDM) proposes that the intention to quit smoking (Iq) is a function of the difference between the motivation to smoke (Ms) and the motivation to quit (Mq):(1)\nThe focus on these competing motivations is not novel; other models of health behavior change, such as PMT [17] and the HBM [18], suggest that intending to quit an unhealthy behavior is a function of influences on these competing motivations. Indeed, any theory of rational choice suggests that all the smoker needs in order to quit is more desire to do so than to continue smoking [27].\nThe distinction between the motivations stems from the reward system’s powerful influence on goal seeking [21] and its circuits specialized for detecting both harmful (negative) and beneficial (positive) environments [28]. These circuits produce corresponding forms of negative and positive affect that, respectively, underlie desires to avoid or approach such objects as cigarettes [29]. Although these desires are often reciprocally related, they are independent sources of motivation that can have unique influences and effects.\nIn addition to the essential role of desires, the EDM recognizes that motivation is also determined by the perceived efficacy to satisfy desires. Self-efficacy is a familiar concept that has long been featured in models of behavior change [30]. In regard to smoking, even if smokers desire to quit the habit, they are unlikely to try unless they believe that they can implement the behavior. Neuroscience models of addiction also focus on self-efficacy by emphasizing the important role of the brain’s control system in undermining the ability to quit an addiction. Theories of behavior change, such as the TRA (15), treat desires (e.g., attitudes) and efficacy as additive influences on intentions. However, because both efficacy and desire are needed to motivate behavior, the EDM treats these expectancies and desires as multiplicative determiners of motivation, a common assumption in psychological models of motivation [31]. Thus, inserting the respective efficacies (Eq, Es) and desires (Dq, Ds) for quitting and smoking into eq. (1) produces:(2)\nFor an addiction such as smoking, both components of Ms are likely to be high. Indeed, the more one practices a behavior, the greater the skill and sense of efficacy for controlling it [32]. The same is unfortunately not the case for quitting. Even if the smoker wants to quit (Dq), no motivation and hence intention will be formed unless the smoker’s sense of efficacy (Eq) is also high. As is often the case for addictive habits [33], the smoker may strongly desire to quit but not believe that it is possible to do so. However, in deriving predictions from this model, it is important to consider individual differences in the various components of the model and the ways in which they are related to each other.\nFigure 1 shows the relations between the components of the model at the individual level. Although desire and efficacy to engage in a behavior are likely to be positively related, we show no relation between Ds and Es under the assumption that Es has reached asymptote in most smokers, leaving little room for any relation with Ds. However, for quitting an addictive habit, such as smoking, the relation between efficacy and desire to quit is likely to be negative. Efficacy for quitting the behavior is at its peak in the early stages of acquiring the habit, usually in adolescence, when the young smoker believes he or she will not have much difficulty stopping [34]. However, as the habit progresses, the smoker finds it increasingly difficult to stop even if the desire to do so increases. This process creates an inverse relation between Eq and Dq.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.  Efficacy-Desire Model of quit intentions showing relations between components of the model as they relate to the reward and control systems of addiction models.Dq and Ds are the desire to quit and smoke, respectively; Eq and Es are efficacies for quitting and smoking respectively. Respective interactions between efficacy and desire lead to Mq and Ms, which directly affect the intention to try quitting (Iq). Dashed paths indicate inverse relations; curved paths are correlations rather than effects.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0054937.g001Neuroscience models of addiction specifically predict that greater frequency of smoking (represented in Figure 1 by parameter β) reduces Eq while it simultaneously increases Ds. It is also likely that frequency of smoking increases Dq, given what we know about smokers’ wishes to quit. But even leaving this out of the model, neuroscience models of addiction predict that the more one smokes, the lower one’s quit-efficacy (hence lower Mq) and the greater one’s desire to continue smoking (hence higher Ms). This disparity between Mq and Ms makes it difficult for the smoker to quit and shows why smokers are so conflicted by their addiction, wishing to quit but nevertheless continuing the habit.\nThe model makes interesting predictions regarding the effects of a warning, which, based on what we know about their effects [9]–[11], should increase Dq and reduce Ds. Figure 1 shows such a warning (whose intensity is indicated by parameter α) directly affecting Dq. Because Dq and Eq are inversely related, the effect on Dq is:(3)\nReplacing Dq in eq. (2) with eq. (3) shows that the model makes the novel prediction that for an addictive habit, Mq is an inverted U-shape function of Eq:\nThat is, assuming that individual differences in Eq range from negative to positive valence, Mq rises as Eq increases, but at an intermediate point, begins to decline. Although theories of behavior change predict that efforts to change behavior increase as efficacy increases, the EDM suggests that, for an addictive habit, this effect only holds up to a point, after which the motivation to do so declines. Furthermore, whether the habit is addictive or not, the effect of α depends on Eq, with an enhanced effect for positive values of Eq and a depressed effect for negative values of Eq.\nThe path linking Ds and Dq in Figure 1 suggests that these desires should be inversely related. However, consistent with a bivalent model of affect [29], we assume that these desires are somewhat independent. Hence, the effect of the warning on Ds is:(4)\nEq. (4) expresses the intuitive result that Ds is positively related to the heaviness of the habit (β) and inversely related to the strength of the warning (α). Inserting eqs. (3) and (4) into eq. (2) yields the following overall relationship between Iq and the respective efficacies for quitting and smoking:(5)\nWe show examples of the hypothetical relation between Iq and Eq for different values of α in Figure 2A, assuming that Es and β are constant and that Es is higher on average than Eq (.5 vs. 0). The inverted U-shape relation is especially apparent when α  = 0. This shows that persons who smoke will have equally weak intentions to quit smoking not only when their efficacy is low but also when it is high. Indeed, absent any health warnings, smokers will have the greatest intentions to quit when their efficacy is at a moderate level. The prediction that low efficacy produces low intentions is not surprising since most theories expect this result. However, the model also predicts that those who think they can quit easily will not be motivated to do so either. This is a critical prediction of the model that will be tested for the first time in the present research.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 2.

Panel B shows the observed relation using scores predicted by regression model in Table 4 (step 1).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0054937.g002A second critical prediction of the model is the effect of the warning. As seen in Figure 2A, the effect of α primarily increases the intention to quit among those with  That is the point in the relation where all three curves in Figure 2A converge. Indeed, those with weaker Eq than −Es actually begin to exhibit a reduction in quit intention. Thus, the model makes the counterintuitive prediction that those with the strongest desires to quit (i.e., those who have smoked the longest) will be least motivated to respond rationally to warnings about the hazards of their habit, and this will be the case despite the fact that their response to the warning (created by an increase in α) is just as strong as the response among those with weaker desires to quit. This may explain the paradoxical effects of warnings observed in previous research. The quit-enhancing effects of increases in α will primarily be observed among those whose efficacy for quitting exceeds their efficacy for smoking. Indeed, warnings for those with weak efficacy for quitting will actually result in weaker intentions to quit.\nWe tested the major predictions of the model in an experimental context in which smokers were randomly assigned to see one example of a pack of cigarettes with a warning that was varied systematically in intensity across experimental conditions. This provided the opportunity to observe the effects of a warning in the context of individual differences in both the efficacy and desire components of the model. In addition to the predicted U-shape function shown in Figure 2A, we tested the prediction that increases in the intensity of warnings (represented by α) produced by adding an emotionally charged picture will lead to divergent effects on Iq depending on Eq. In addition, the EDM predicts that the greater the amount smoked (β), the lower the intention to quit. However, variation in β should only shift the curve up or down (it should be independent of Eq and α), and it should only interact with Es, which we assume is at a high and relatively fixed level for all smokers. In addition, as shown in Figure 1, frequency of smoking should be inversely related to Eq but positively related to Ds. Finally, in support of the expected inverse relation between Eq and Dq, length of time smoking (using age of the smoker as a proxy) should be positively related to Dq but negatively related to Eq.\n\nMethods\nEthics Statement\nThe research was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Pennsylvania, which adheres to the principles of the Belmont Report. As the survey was conducted over the Internet, was completed anonymously, and posed minimal risk, the IRB waived the requirement for written consent. However, participants were informed that the survey involved research, that their responses were anonymous, and that their participation was entirely voluntary. Thus, proceeding to take the survey was considered documentation of consent.\n\n\nMaterials and Participants\nWe tested the model’s predictions using warnings that were tested for use in the U.S. by the FDA [13]. We used the same adult Internet panel used by the FDA (Research Now [35]) and similar warning labels that FDA evaluated. However, smokers who had participated in the earlier FDA test were excluded from the study.\nPanel members were included in the study if they reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lives and if they currently smoked cigarettes “every day” or “some days” (N = 3297). Most of the sample reported smoking every day (62%), a lower proportion than the nearly 80% observed in recent national surveys of U. S. smokers [36]. In this test, approximately 160 smokers (56.5% female) in each of two age groups (18–24 and 25+ years) were randomly exposed to one of 10 computer screen images of a cigarette pack containing a warning about the hazards of smoking (see examples in Figure 3). The mean ages of the two age groups were 22.1 (SD  = 1.60) and 44.3 (SD  = 13.91). As expected, the older smokers were more likely to smoke every day compared to the younger group (76.5% vs. 45.7%), X2(1)  = 329, p<.001.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 3.

S. Congress (Figure 3A): Cigarettes cause cancer, Cigarettes are addictive, or Smoking during pregnancy can harm your baby. These statements are factually correct but do not convey the importance and emotional impact imparted by pictorial warnings [9], [10]. In the middle level of intensity (α  = .5), the smoker saw the front of a similarly designed pack but with both the text and a picture that covered the top half of the pack (Figure 3B). In the third condition (α  = 1), the smoker saw a frontal view of the pack with a picture, the base text, and in addition, explanatory text that elaborated on the basis for the warning (Figure 3C). Elaborated warnings have been used in Canada since they were introduced in 2000 [9]. We expected the additional text to enhance the warning, resulting in the highest level of α. There were two versions of the elaborated text for the addiction and pregnancy warnings and one for the cancer warning, but we did not include a picture plus base text version for the cancer message. Thus, there were 10 different conditions with respondents nested within each condition in the experiment.\nRespondents were permitted to view the warning image for as long as they wished; however, they were not permitted to return to it after leaving the screen. They then answered a series of questions about their reaction to the warning. We assessed quit intentions (Iq) with the following question: “How likely do you think it is that you will try to quit smoking within the next 30 days?” This question format is commonly used to determine intent because it captures both the desire and ability to engage in the behavior within a specified time period [15]. This question was answered using a scale from (1) very unlikely to (4) very likely. Those with no opinion (3.2%) were assigned the score of 2.5.\nWe assessed efficacy beliefs for quitting (Eq) by averaging agreement with two moderately correlated items (r  = .33, p<.001): “It is hard for a smoker to quit smoking” (reversed scored) and “I do not need help from anyone to quit smoking.” Both items were rated on a scale from (1) strongly disagree to (5) strongly agree. We also assessed previous quit attempts with the question: “During the past 12 months, have you stopped smoking for one day or longer because you were trying to quit smoking?” (Yes/No). This item was assessed to provide a behavorial measure of quitting that should also exhibit the inverted U-shape relation with Eq prior to exposure to the warning.\nWe assessed the direct effects of the warnings on measures of Dq and Ds as checks on the success of the manipulation of warning intensity (α). Our measure of desire to quit smoking (Dq) was response to: “How much do you want to quit smoking?” with answers ranging from “not at all” (1) to “a lot” (4). To assess Ds, we asked two questions that probed emotional reactions to smoking and desire to smoke a cigarette: “Imagine you are smoking right now. How good or bad would you feel smoking a cigarette right now?” with responses ranging from “very good” (1) to “very bad” (4). The other item asked for agreement with: “I want a cigarette right now” (reversed scored). The items were correlated (r  = .33, p<.001) and were averaged to define a measure of aversion to smoking, the inverse of Ds. As expected by the model in Figure 1, our measures of Dq and -Ds were correlated (r  = .25, p<.001). Finally, answers to the question about frequency of smoking, “Do you smoke, every day (1), some days (0) or never?” were used to assess β.\nWe used linear regression to test eq. (5) using self-efficacy to quit as a measure of Eq and three levels of α (0,.5, 1) as values representing the experimental warning conditions. A test of the effect of β was conducted with a second model in which smoking frequency was added as a predictor. Predicted scores from these models were plotted to provide a visual comparison of model predictions with those in Figure 2A. A test of the U-shape relation between Eq and prior quitting behavior was also tested using logistic regression and quit attempts in the 12 months prior to the experiment. We conducted regression analyses to test the predicted effects of age, α and β on all of the observed mediators in Figure 1 (Eq, Dq, −Ds). We did not have a measure of Es, which we assumed was relatively high for all smokers and which should be positively related to β in any case. A test of the critical hypothesis that efficacy for quitting is inversely related to desire to quit was conducted by regressing Dq on Eq. As predicted by eq. (3), those with the weakest efficacy should have the strongest desire to quit.\n\nResultsTable 1 provides the response distributions for the major variables in the analysis. To assess the success of randomization to conditions, we examined differences between conditions on several outcomes. There were no differences between the 10 conditions in efficacy for quitting, F(9,3287)  = .868, p  = .55; the proportion of respondents who smoked every day (vs. some days), X2(9)  = 10.32, p  = .33; or who had tried to quit in the past 12 months, X2(9)  = 9.41, p  = .40.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 1.

Consistent with eq. (3), Eq was inversely related to Dq (Table 2 and Figure 4A). This confirms the hypothesis that forms the basis for the U-shape relation between efficacy and intention to quit smoking. Related to this hypothesis is the prediction that smoking frequency (β) is inversely related to quit efficacy (Eq). As seen in Table 3 and Figure 4B, this hypothesis was supported, with each increasing unit on the efficacy scale associated with lower rates of daily smoking. Frequency of smoking was also inversely related to −Ds. Table 2 also shows the relation between age and the three outcomes, all of which are consistent with the model. Age was positively related to Dq and negatively related to Eq. It was also positively related to −Ds.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 4.

Parameters of logistic regression models for relation between efficacy and frequency of smoking and prior attempts to quit.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0054937.t003Smoking frequency was negatively related to Dq in Table 2. However, this could happen because it was positively related to Ds, which would counteract a potentially positive relation with Dq. To evaluate this possibility, we conducted a separate analysis in which Ds was held constant. This analysis confirmed that smoking frequency was positively related to Dq (B  = .134, se  = .037, p<.001), which would add further to the negative relation between Eq and Dq.\nExamining the rate at which smokers had tried to quit in the past 12 months provided a test of the predicted inverted U-shape relation between Eq and behavior. As seen in Figure 4C, this relation exhibited an inverted-U shape as defined by the logistic regression model in Table 3. That model also found that smoking frequency was inversely related to prior quit attempts.\nAs expected, experimental variation in warning intensity (scaled 0, .5, 1) increased aversion to smoking (−Ds), one indicator of α. This effect was independent of efficacy, age, and smoking frequency, indicating that smokers across the efficacy continuum and ages recognized the implications of the warnings. It is noteworthy that Eq was unrelated to aversion to smoking. This was in contrast to its negative relation with desire to quit smoking. This difference is actually consistent with our predictions concerning each desire. It should be recalled that Ds was a function of β – α, while Dq was a function of α – Eq. Thus, one would not expect Eq to predict –Ds, holding constant β. It would nevertheless be expected that the warning would affect both desires. It is disappointing to find that the effect of α was not significant for our measure of Dq. A more sensitive measure of Dq may have allowed the relation between warning and Dq to emerge more clearly. Nevertheless, the measures of –Ds and Dq were related (r  = .25, p<.001), which supports their predicted relationship in the model.\nFigure 2B shows the relation between Iq and Eq as a function of the three different levels of warning intensity as predicted by the regression model in Table 4. Comparing the result with the prediction in Figure 2A indicates a remarkably similar pattern to what the model predicted. First, the overall relation between intention and Eq exhibited the inverted-U shape. Second, the interaction between warning level and quit efficacy was significant: Intentions to quit smoking were elevated as a function of α primarily among those with efficacy scores above the estimated level of Es, which appeared to be approximately .40 in this sample (based on the intersection of the three curves in Figure 2B). The mean level of Eq in the sample was only −.22 (se  =  .017), considerably lower than the observed level of Es in Figure 2B. Thus, only those with scores of Eq>−Es (representing about 36% of the sample) were likely to exhibit greater intentions in response to the warning. The remaining 64% either did not change or became somewhat less likely to intend to quit. Finally and not surprisingly, the simple effect of α did not contribute to prediction. Thus, without examining the interaction between efficacy and warning level, one would conclude (as observed before) that warnings have little overall influence on intentions to quit.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 4.  Regression parameters in test of Efficacy-Desire Model.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0054937.t004To evaluate the success of the predicted relation between Iq and both Eq and α, we compared the variance explained by this model that only used 5 degrees of freedom to a model that included separate predictors for each of the 23 degrees of freedom represented by the fixed effects of the two predictors. Our model explained 71% of the fixed effects in the data despite using many fewer degrees of freedom. In addition, after accounting for the variation that was due to sampling error (which can be estimated by the within-subject mean square which was approximately 15% of the total), it is likely that the model accounted for over 80% of the reliable variation in the fixed effects.\nA final prediction of the model concerned the level of current smoking (β). We tested this effect by examining the relation between Iq and Eq for daily smokers versus those who smoked less often. As seen in Table 4 (step 2), smoking frequency predicted quit intentions apart from efficacy and warning intensity as predicted by eq. (5). Figure 5 shows that the curves predicted by the model in Table 4 conformed to prediction, with the curve shifting down for daily smokers without changing the inverted U-shape of the relation.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 5.  Predicted relation based on regression model in Table 4 (step 2) between intention and efficacy to quit with frequency of smoking as the parameter.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0054937.g005Our results showed strong support for predictions from the EDM. The inverted U-shape function between quit efficacy and strength of intentions to quit smoking was supported for both quit attempts in the past year and in response to a warning about cigarette hazards. This finding reflects the model’s unique prediction that given smoking’s addictive properties, the desire to quit smoking (Dq) and efficacy to do so (Eq) are inversely related and that these components of the decision model combine multiplicatively to form the motivation and hence intention to quit. The model’s prediction regarding the effect of a warning on quit intention was also supported in that the effect of the warning was only favorable for those with Eq>−Es. Indeed, as Eq declined, the warning became ineffective, exhibiting a boomerang effect. Finally, the prediction that smoking frequency would shift the intention curve up or down but would not interact with quit efficacy was also supported.The findings show why previous research has failed to observe effects of warnings on the quit intentions of smokers at the population level [13], [14]. Even though smokers at all levels of efficacy recognized the implications of the warnings (as assessed by the effect on −Ds), it was primarily smokers with stronger quit-efficacy who reported increased intentions to try to quit. Ironically, the smokers who most desired to quit (i.e., those with lower efficacy) displayed reduced intentions. Thus, the effects of health warnings were limited to lighter smokers who have relatively stronger efficacy beliefs regarding quitting than they have regarding smoking. This pattern is consistent with research showing that it is primarily lighter smokers that are successful in quitting programs [37], [38]. Thus, the results suggest that the question regarding pictorial warnings is not whether they are effective in helping smokers to quit, but for which groups they are likely to be helpful. Our findings and the EDM indicate that level of smoking and efficacy for quitting are important parameters in determining the effects of pictorial warnings.Although most theories of health behavior change would predict that smokers with greater quit efficacy would be more likely to respond favorably to a warning, the EDM is unique in predicting this outcome when Eq>−Es. It is also unique in its ability to predict the conditions under which one will observe a boomerang effect. Finally, the EDM uniquely predicts the inverted U-shape relation between Eq and Iq for an addictive habit. We thus see the model as providing important insights into the effects of health warnings that have not been predicted by previous theories of behavior change.The finding that smokers with weaker self-efficacy for quitting actually became less intent on quitting following exposure to warnings is not a new phenomenon. This adverse effect of health information has been observed in studies of smoking and alcohol use [17]. Indeed, the classical study by Janis and Feshbach [39] found that, as the fear arousing character of messages increased, intention to follow through with the recommended health practice declined. This finding led to the prediction that fear arousing messages will exhibit an inverted U-shape relation to behavior change, whereby increases in fear initially lead to greater change but to decreases after an intermediate level has been reached. Contrary to this hypothesis, however, subsequent research failed to find the inverted U-shaped relation. Indeed, most research finds a weak but positive relation between fear arousal and message acceptance [40].The EDM predicts a positive relation between the intensity of the message (i.e., α) and intentions/behavior when the efficacy for the recommended behavior exceeds that of the pre-existing unhealthy behavior. However, the model predicts decreases in behavioral intentions for those with relatively weak self-efficacy. It is quite likely that this was the case in Janis and Feshbach, which tested the effects of complex recommendations for repeated tooth brushing in early adolescents. Thus, the EDM could predict the effect observed by Janis and Feshbach and others that messages that increase fear regarding the recommended behavior will nevertheless backfire for those who have weak efficacy to change. The finding that such boomerang effects occur more often for addictive behaviors [17] is also consistent with the model. Furthermore, the EDM provides more precise predictions for the conditions under which one can expect such boomerang effects.The tendency to reject messages as they increase in fear-arousing capacity has been ascribed to “defensive processing” in which the recipient of the message argues against the message and thus rejects its recommendation [40]–[42]. However, the EDM and the present results suggest that defensive processing is not necessary to explain message rejection. Smokers at all levels of self-efficacy reported increased unpleasant thoughts about smoking and felt disinclined to smoke a cigarette shortly following exposure to the warning. These reactions suggest that they did not reject the message outright. Instead, the results are more consistent with the prediction from the EDM that the multiplicative relation between desire and self-efficacy to quit leads to less motivation to adopt the recommended behavior among those with low Eq. As their desire to quit increased, their negative level of self-efficacy reduced rather than increased their motivation to quit, leaving them less intent on quitting.Aside from effects of warnings on quit intentions, the EDM predicts that addictive behaviors will exhibit an inverted U-shape function in relation to quit efficacy. This novel prediction was supported both for prior attempts to quit as well as immediate reactions to warnings. Thus, it was not just intentions that reflected this pattern but reports of behavior. Although this relationship has not to our knowledge been identified before, it is consistent with the observation that those who engage in behaviors that are difficult to quit often lose the motivation to desist from the unhealthy habit even if they succeed in reducing the behavior [33]. The EDM’s explanation for this phenomenon is that as the efficacy for quitting increases, it is matched by reduced desire to quit. As a result, the motivation to quit declines. However, increasing the desire to quit, as was done in the present experiment, should allow the beneficial effects of high quit efficacy to emerge.The model also shows why smokers find it so difficult to quit. If smokers succeed in reducing their smoking habit as represented by the influence of β (perhaps by ingesting nicotine through a patch), they will experience less Ds, which will reduce Ms. Indeed, the model indicates that a reduction in β will raise Iq independent of α and Eq. However, as proposed in Figure 1, a reduction in β increases Eq. This moves them closer to the right side of the inverted-U relation with Iq. Thus, any favorable effects mediated by Ds will be offset and potentially outweighed by an opposite effect on Eq. These opposing forces could actually lead to a decrease in quit intention. As a result, once an addictive habit is created, the forces that motivate it can entrap the addict in a difficult to break cycle of continued dependence on the habit.Despite the favorable effects of warnings suggested by the EDM, the model also predicts that the quit intentions of those with weak efficacy beliefs will be reduced as a result of exposure to warnings. This suggests that an effective public health strategy will require a two-pronged approach. One priority should be to encourage all smokers to reduce their habit as a transitory goal to eventually quitting. Although most smokers may not be able to quit, they may be able to reduce the strength of their habit. Indeed, recent surveys suggest that U.S. smokers have been doing exactly that [36]. The model suggests that recent efforts to reduce Es, through price increases and restrictions on smoking in public, may have been responsible for these reductions. That is, as long as  is greater than zero, decreasing Es should increase Iq. Since this condition is likely to be the case for heavy smokers, efforts to reduce Es should increase Iq. However, because reductions in smoking can also sap the motivation to quit, it will also be necessary to counteract this tendency with repeated exposure to health warnings that are periodically refreshed so that their effect does not wear off. This could enable persons who smoke to maintain stronger quit intentions and to break free of the habit.This study has limitations that should be examined in subsequent research. The findings are based on only a single exposure and the effects of warnings may intensify as smokers are exposed to warnings over time. The model predicts that the lightest smokers with the strongest self-efficacy for quitting will be most successful in quitting. However, we have not tested this hypothesis here. We also did not have a very sensitive measure of β, which the model suggests is a major factor in intentions to quit. Finally, we did not assess self-efficacy for smoking, which the model predicts will have an influence on quitting. We assumed that it was relatively high compared to self-efficacy for quitting. However, future research should look at variation in this form of self-efficacy as well. This parameter could be assessed by asking about barriers to smoking that the smoker experiences, such as restrictions on places to smoke, increases in prices for cigarettes, and social disapproval for smoking.In conclusion, the EDM sheds light on why models that assume a rational response to warnings do not account for the behavior of persons addicted to a behavior such as smoking. The model translates insights from current neurobiological models of addiction [19], [22]–[25] into concepts that have been employed in models of behavior change [15], [17], [18]: namely, attitudes toward addictive habits (desire) and the lack of control over their cessation (self-efficacy). The model is also consistent with neuroscience theories that postulate separate approach and avoidance motives that underlie affective experience and that can produce extreme conflict in persons with a serious addiction such as smoking. Thus, the model shows how the barriers to quitting an addictive habit such as smoking are so imposing that they can trap the person who is addicted in a continuing cycle of dependence and frustrate efforts to reduce this life-threatening habit."

            "fulltext": "IntroductionIt is broadly recognized that the specific behavior of individuals is conditioned by individual factors, home-site factors [1], [2], [3], [4], [5] and a set of formal rules and socially accepted informal rules [6], such as those of family or culture. Personality also plays a role in human behavior and thus, can influence environmental concerns [7], environmental engagement [8] and consumer decisions on environmental goods and services [9].\nSeveral environmental studies have considered the influence of attitudes or tastes [10], [11], [12], [13] and psychological constructs [14], [15] on individual preferences. The influence of personality dimensions on environmental preferences has been less examined. To correct this gap, a reduced version of the BFI such as the BFI-10 is a suitable instrument to incorporate personality traits in environmental valuation, since it is a recommended approach for research in which participant time is limited and when personality assessment would otherwise be impossible. Environmental economics and more specifically, environmental valuation, uses survey-based instruments to analyze consumer behavior among natural and environmental resources. In this case, the BFI-10 shows acceptable psychometric properties [16] and is a suitable instrument to introduce the personality traits into the economic analysis.\nThe Big Five Inventory (BFI) is a personality survey based on a set of phrases used to measure the Big Five dimensions of personality, i.e., extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness [17]. Although BFI can be answered in less than 10 minutes, there is a growing demand for shorter instruments [18], [19], [20]. Reduced scales of BFI cannot be used as a common approach to assess personality [16], [20], but is a good alternative to implement personality in other scientific disciplines different from psychology, such as economics.\nThe paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical underpinnings of Discrete Choice Experiments and the BFI-10. Section 3 outlines the questionnaire used to analyze the influence of personality traits on environmental valuation. In Section 4 we present the main results of the study. Finally, Section 5 is devoted to conclusions and discussion.\nMaterials and Methods\nThe BFI-10\nThe Big Five Traits allow us to classify people by analyzing their ratings in a set of short phrases characterizing five independent personality dimensions. Following [16], the BFI-10 was implemented in order to analyze the influence of personality traits in environmental valuation. Ten short phrases were used to represent the big five personality dimensions, with just 2 items per dimension (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness). Individuals rate these 10 short phrases (Table 1) describing their personality on a five-step scale from 1 (disagree strongly) to 5 (agree strongly).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 1.  Short phrase items used in the BFI-10.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0089603.t001A comprehensive analysis of different interpretations of these dimensions is presented in [21], [22]. For the purpose of this article, we summarize the focal interpretation of the five personality dimensions:\n\n\n\n\nExtraversion: people classified as “extroverts” show social adaptability and interpersonal involvement, and they are talkative, assertive, active, outgoing, and outspoken. Therefore, we expect a positive likelihood of these people contributing to the development of a new environmental program.\n\nAgreeableness: this dimension implies pro-social behavior, and people scoring high on agreeableness tend to be sympathetic, kindly, appreciative, affectionate, soft-hearted, warm and generous. There is no prior expectation for the influence of this dimension on choices for the environmental program. Nevertheless, a significant positive effect could be interpreted as a warm-glow bias (friendly behavior).\n\nConscientiousness: they are organized, thorough, playful, efficient, responsible and reliable. They are “global-thinkers” and, due to the regional character of the proposed environmental program, we expect a negative or non-significant relationship between high scores in this dimension and the probability of accepting a small (not far-reaching) environmental program.\n\nNeuroticism: typically, people classified as “neurotics” are tense, anxious, nervous, moody, and tend to worry. Therefore, a negative relationship is expected between high scores in this dimension and the probability of accepting a novel environmental program. These personalities might tend to choose the status quo option rather an option of change [9]. Moreover, we expect extreme behaviors and a high dispersion of responses from neurotics.\n\nOpenness: these are people open to experience; they have wide interests and are imaginative, intelligent and original. Therefore, we expect a positive likelihood of these people contributing to the development of a new environmental program.\n\n\n\nDiscrete choice experiments\nDiscrete Choice Experiments (DCEs) simulate markets in which different environmental goods and services compete in a realistic trade-off manner. Individuals choose between different alternatives involving environmental attributes, according to their own preferences and budget constraints. DCEs allow researchers to infer consumers' preferences and implicit prices for several characteristics embedded in a prospective policy or environmental program. Since accounting for unobserved heterogeneity is a matter of importance in the estimation of behavioral models, two mixed approaches are applied: a Random Parameter Logit (RPL) model [23] and a Latent Class (LC) Model [24].\nThe RPL model introduces unobserved preference heterogeneity, i.e., allows the coefficients of observed variables to vary randomly among people rather than being fixed. In RPL models, the individual's i indirect utility function (Vi) is usually represented as a linear additive expression:(1)where αj is an alternative specific constant (ASC) for each option (j =  1,2,...,J) in the choice set, Sij is the associated attribute vector,  is the vector of population mean preference values, θi represents the deviations in individual preferences with respect to the mean values, and  is an i.i.d. type I extreme value random component of utility which cannot be observed by the researcher. Coefficients β vary in the population with density ƒ(β|Ω), with Ω denoting the parameters of density. If we assume that the individual's preferences, as represented by βi  =   +θi, follow the same decision heuristics for all choice (t =  1,2,..,T), the probability of individual i's observed sequence of choices [y1, y2,...,yT] is calculated by solving the integral:(2)where j is the alternative chosen in choice occasion t and μ is a scale parameter.\nAs pointed above, another way to capture taste variations is through LC or by a combination of LC and RPL. In this study we apply a latent class model with common and specific random parameters. Latent class has been long applied in environmental modeling, but not many studies combine both mixed approaches. Some examples of the dynamism of LC can be seen in [25], describing the choice of excursions in natural protected areas; [26] for transport issues; or [4], [27] for valuing environmental goods.\nFollowing [24], the model has several classes (x) for the probability that case i selects alternative j at the replication t, given attribute value  (characteristics of alternatives), covariates , used to predict class membership (x), and random parameters (RP) denoted by Fdi being d the number of factors. The Fdi are assumed to be standard normally distributed and mutually independent () where I is the identity matrix.\nIn a general case, with a conditional logit model, the response probability is:(3)where  is the systematic component in the utility of alternative j at replication t given that case i belongs to latent class x. The linear model is:\n(4)The term  is a linear function of an alternative specific constant , attribute effects  and random effects. The first term () defines random effects for the alternative specific constants, and the following terms define random effects for the attributes.\nIn a latent class choice model with random parameters, the probability density has this form:(5)where\n(6)A multinomial logit is specified in which class membership is regressed on covariates;(7)with linear term , being  the constant corresponding to latent class x and  the effect of the rth covariate for the Class x.\nIn our study, personal traits are included as covariates to explain belonging to a specific class, assuming that members of the same class share a pattern of choice. On the other hand, we assume that attributes from the discrete choice experiment behave randomly. This specification allows us to identify whether one or more attributes are not random to a specific class, improving the accuracy of the model.\n\n\nThe environmental valuation questionnaire\nThe choice experiment aims to quantify the population's preferences for several externalities associated with a program developing resin-tapping in Spain, i.e., biodiversity of flora, employment generated by the strengthening of the sector, reduced risk of fire, the presence in the market of “certified products” that incorporate natural resin, and the duration and the annual cost of the program. The levels presented are detailed in Table 2.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 2.  Attributes and Levels of the Choice Experiment.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0089603.t002The discrete choice experiment is implemented in an environmental valuation questionnaire structured in 4 sections. Section 1 contains questions relating to the relationships between the interviewee and forests. The second section examines knowledge about resin-tapping activities. Section 3 contains the discrete choice experiment. The choice sets were designed following an optimal in difference design as proposed by [28]. From an optimal design size of 18 choice cards, a blocking strategy was performed and each respondent was confronted with nine choice cards containing two prospective programs and the status quo scenario (where the program is not implemented and the individual does not pay any extra fee). The experimental design is balanced, i.e. all the attribute levels are shown the same number of times to each individual. In general, unbalanced designs should be avoided where possible because statistical power differs within attribute levels and/or between attributes, and artificial correlations with grand means or model intercepts are introduced [29].\nFinally, the fourth section is focused on socio-economic characteristics and includes the BFI-10 questions. The questionnaire was administered in September and October 2012 to 2,224 individuals. The target population was adult dwellers from Castilla y León, since resin-tapping activities in Spain are concentrated in this region (located in central Spain). The database used for this analysis is available on request from the authors.\n\nResultsFrom the individuals' ratings on the BFI-10 short-phrases items, the average score is calculated for each of the big five personality dimensions. The results are shown in Table 3. Conscientiousness shows the higher value and neuroticism shows the lower one, whereas extraversion, agreeableness and openness show similar values. Low correlations are detected for the five dimensions of personality. This is a good indicator of the independence of these personality dimensions.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 3.

All attributes, apart from the cost and the Alternative Specific Constant (ASC) were assumed to be normally distributed. Differences of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) between a baseline model (without including personality traits) and the expanded-BFI model favored the selection of the last one. The purpose of using these explanatory variables in our analysis is focused on getting a better understanding on the relation between personality traits and choices, to help us explaining why individuals prefer certain things over others. The ASC was introduced in the models as a dummy variable taking value 1 to indicate that the individual does not choose the status quo scenario. The estimated coefficient for the ASC is statistically non-significant. This result suggests that individual heterogeneity is correctly captured by the model.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 4.  Random Parameters Model results.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0089603.t004From these results (Table 4) we can state that personality dimensions have an effect on the choices individuals make. Our results show that the most influential trait is openness, that is, individuals showing a high score in openness (people open to new experiences) are more prone to choose the options for protection than people with other dominant traits. All covariates have the expected sign except agreeableness, for which we did not have any a priori expectations about the sign. Since stated preference techniques are prone to get a positive answer from individuals whatever they are offered, our hypothesis was that individuals who show this trait could favor the yea-saying bias.\nIt would thus be worthwhile to know which aspects of the personality make us value certain attributes over others; that is, the influence of personality traits on preferences for environmental programs. For this we run a latent class model using Latent Gold 4.5 software. In order to benefit from the virtues of the RPL models, we consider that some attributes may have just one source of variability (for FireL, FireM, Time, CertM and CertH) while for others (Employ, BioM, BioH and Cost) we identified two, one dependent on the class and another constant for all the classes. In other words, we assume that for some attributes dispersion around the mean estimates is the same for all individuals, like the RPL shown above, while for some other attributes we also have identified variability in the class (intra-class).\nTable 5 shows the mixed LC-RPL model, where the SDPD column contains the Standard Deviations of the estimates for the classes and the last column, Common SDPD shows the Standard Deviations for the variables, regardless of the class. This decomposition of variability has the advantage of informing us about possible sources of heterogeneity. For example, the estimates for medium risk of fire (FireM) are positive for all classes and show high variability for everybody, while for low risk (FireL) the variation is due to the composition of the classes. For some, this is something desirable, while for others it seems it is enough to achieve the medium level; some risk of fire might be acceptable for certain groups of the society because low risk could not be credible or because the cost of achieving that goal may be disproportionate. Fire variables were expected to behave quite homogeneously and have low variability. On the contrary, BioM and BioH show great inter- and intra-class variability, as shown by the common and by-class SD. Cost is another variable with great variation. Traditionally, the cost of the program parameter is considered as fixed, since the elicitation of willingness to pay (WTP) measures complicates the computation. In this study we are not interested in getting the benefits (in terms of willingness to pay) of the program but to control and explain heterogeneity of preferences, thus Cost is considered to have a random nature. Again, two sources of variability have been identified, one common to all individuals no matter the class, and another for the classes. As with the BioM and BioH, for some classes the decisions on this attribute are not random, as is the case for classes 3 and 4. If we go into the composition of the classes attending to their personality traits, we can see that class 4 is the one with lower random behavior and Openness is the trait of their members (around 13% of the sample). The most valued aspect of the program for this class is biodiversity followed by fires, both a medium level but valuing positively high levels of biodiversity and negatively low levels of risk of fires.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 5.  Latent Class Model results.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0089603.t005Classes 1, 2 and 6 are at the other end, showing high variation of their mean parameters. Attending to the personality traits, class 6, which only represents 3% of the sample, has none that could describe their mean personality. Class 2, with almost 22% of the sample, groups the people with low extraversion and positive and high scores on agreeableness and conscientiousness. Class 1 is the biggest with almost 38% of the participants. They have high scores on openness (positive) and on agreeableness (negative). For people in this group cost is the least important attribute and FireL the most important, and they will choose any improvement for the management of these areas. As expected, this group has a high variability on all the parameters. This may be due, among other things, to the fact that is the most populated class.\nA trait that deserves attention is neuroticism, which is significant only for class 3 (14% of the sample) together with a negative openness. Our results confirm [30], indicating that neuroticism could be a weaker predictor of a range of outcomes. As expected, few aspects of the environmental program are appreciated by this group. Key attributes like fire are not even significant. Class 5 (around 11% of the sample) is pro-environmental and the positive sign of cost could have an explanation in the positive and significant traits for this class: extraversion and openness.\nFinally, in Section 2 we hypothesized that a positive and significant Agreeableness could lead to a warm glow behavior, but our results shows that the assertive aspect of Extraversion, combined with other traits could be more prone to this kind of bias (see Class 5). Our experiment is not big enough to provide evidence or establish these relations; thus only further research could lead us to find if those relations are possible.\nThis paper relates personality traits directly with environmental preferences. It shows that personality plays a role in human behavior and thus, it can influence consumer decisions on environmental goods and services. In environmental valuation with stated preference methods a hypothetical market is simulated through a survey instrument. In order to avoid fatigue effects, the survey time is very limited, thus a key issue for implementing personality traits in environmental economics is the time required to answer the psychological questions. For this reason, a reduced version of Big Five Inventory with acceptable psychometric properties (the BFI-10) was applied in order to analyze the influence of personality traits in a discrete choice experiment. Therefore, this paper uses a psychometric approach to highlight the relevance of personality traits in consumer decisions, relating directly personality to economic behavior. Other approaches such as the New Ecological Paradigm scale [31] have connected pro-environmental behavior with economic behavior (i.e. a higher willingness to pay). Moreover, in the literature are numerous examples connecting different types of behavior and, what it is very interesting too, connecting the “values” such as the Schwartz Value Theory [32], [33] to explain individual preferences [34]. Discussions on these issues can be found in several papers from the 2011 International Choice Modelling Conference [35]. We have tried with this experiment to go a step backwards, since we agree in that values are partly inspired by personality. But we recognize that this study is a short piece of the research on the influence of personality on individual preferences, and other relations will be tested in the future.This study brings new insights on the relationship between personality and environmental values. Results show a positive effect of openness and extraversion and a negative effect of agreeableness and neuroticism in consumers' preferences for this environmental program. Nevertheless, these effects are diverse and affect the heterogeneity of preferences, the preferred characteristics and the desirability of the program itself. Further research is necessary to explain, for example, why estimates from individuals with high scores on conscientiousness have higher random behavior than those showing a neuroticism trait. That is, to better explain the relationship between personality traits and tastes and preferences. In summary, this work constitutes a new step to understanding the involvement of individuals in environmental conservation and could help to better design appropriate ways to reach certain groups and ensure the success of environmental and social goals."

            "fulltext": "IntroductionSome psychologists believe that the human reaction of evaluation is unconscious if not all of the encountered stimuli fall on a good or bad dimension. The human reaction of evaluation is presumed to have a transitory avoidance and approach behavioral tendency [1]–[3]. A recent study [3] identified the reference valence effects of affective stimulus–response (S–R) compatibility when visual stimulus materials were used (including visual text and visual images). Matching stimulus materials provides an explanation for the reference valence effects of affective stimulus–response (S–R) compatibility. The match between the stimulus and its referent is a key factor based on the valenced referent. The transitory approach behavioral tendency should be faster for the avoidance behavioral tendency when the target stimulus (such as a positive character) matches the referent (such as a positive personality trait). However, no studies have examined whether the matching account is a reasonable explanation for the reference valence effects of affective S–R compatibility when auditory stimulus materials are used.\n\nFrom the S–R compatibility effect to the affective S–R compatibility effect\nNumerous accounts have interpreted the S–R compatibility effect [4]–[6]. In terms of reaction time and accuracy, the S-R compatibility effect showed that compatibility stimulus-response tasks were better than other tasks. Related research suggested that visual and response selections occur in different stages. In a simple present–absent detection task, participants were slower to respond ‘present’ when the single arrow pointed to the right (corresponding to the right hand). But, when the study changed the conditions (such as encouraging participants to process the identity of the arrow), the S–R compatibility effect was identified [7]. In addition, avoidance cues led to improved performance in cognitive control tasks [8]. A recent study found that an affective stimulus valence contributes to behavior that greatly leads to a compatible transformation in distance [9]. In spatial cognition, the absence of spatial compatibility effects when there is a strong temporal overlap suggests that response conflicts are caused by stimulus-related priming [10]. In the dual processing models of S–R compatibility, the processes of spatial and imitative compatibility are independent [11]. In cognitive mechanisms, negative compatibility effects are generated by perceptual mechanisms [12]. Similarly, reaction activation is affected by negative priming effects. This activation may be generated by a simplified image of a hand [13]. The latest research results cannot be interpreted with current accounts (specific-muscle-activation, evaluative response coding, distance-regulation, etc.) but are in agreement with the matching account [3]. The affective stimulus–response (S–R) compatibility effect demonstrates that participants are faster to avoid negative stimuli than to approach negative words. Similarly, participants are faster to approach positive stimuli than to avoid positive words [1]. In previous studies of visual positive and negative stimulation, it was not clear whether auditory stimuli have the same effect. The activity of mechanism is reflected in two aspects: valence effects and approach/avoidance action.\n\n\nValence effects\nStudies of valence effects are mainly concentrated in the following areas: gender differences, personality, emotions and brain cognition. The dependence of valence-specific effects in facial emotion perception on the perceiver's gender is unclear [14]. Regarding gender, small developmental increases occur more for the effects of valence than for arousal [15]. Regarding personality, positive adjectives are better recalled than negative adjectives when they are encoded in reference to the self [16]. Regarding trait identification, participants perform much better in positive versus negative behavior [17]. The valence of self-evaluative thoughts is thought to mediate the impact of personality traits on mood [18]. In the field of emotion, the effect of arousal on the connectivity within the emotional memory network depends on item valence [19] A valence-specific laterality effect is demonstrated in original stimuli when stimuli of the same emotion are presented as a block [20]. Experiments following ‘no think’ instructions for memories associated with emotionally negative material lead to significant memory suppression [21]. In addition, imagery manipulates emotional valence and arousal [22]. Mneimne found significant valence through visual field interactions [23]. In brain cognition, corrugator muscle activity are associated with left hemi-face dominance during high and low arousal negative picture blocks, whereas zygomaticus muscle activity are associated with right hemi-face dominance during high arousal positive picture blocks [24].\n\n\nApproach and avoidance action\nApproach and avoidance motivation (or action) is very important for human function [3]. In a study with stimulation materials, an avoidance strategy was more effective in decreasing prejudice in a negative context rather than in a positive context [25]. Movement times are slower in the context of avoidance conflicts relative to approach conflicts [26]. In social cognition, some evidence indicates that avoidance temperament (neuroticism and negative affectivity) is a predictor of an approach goal, and approach temperament (extraversion and positive affectivity) is a predictor of an avoidance goal [27]. Approach/avoidance moderates the impact of comparison information on self-evaluation [28].\n\n\nCurrent study\nParticipants are faster to avoid negative stimuli than to approach negative words; similarly, participants are faster to approach positive stimuli than to avoid positive words [1]. The activity of mechanism is reflected in two aspects: valence effect, approach and avoidance action. Some studies on the valence effects of S–R compatibility exist, but studies on stimulation materials of audition are rare. The studies were based on vision, thus it is not clear if auditory stimuli have the same effect. One's perception of emotional content depends on auditory and visual cues. Auditory stimulus may affect reference valence effects of affective S–R compatibility. Auditory cues contain fundamental frequency changes during an utterance [29]–[30]. The related research shows that visual stimuli influence neural representation in the auditory cortex and may override auditory perceptions derived from auditory stimuli [31]. In our life, a lot of information belongs to auditory stimuli (e.g., the sound of the car). When crossing the street, it is assumed that the sound of speeding car can be heard, will you be more quickly to avoid this kind of negative stimuli? Visual and auditory stimulus are different for human to process according to the human physiology. In addition, the visual processing is a kind of image processing, while auditory processing is more a kind of meaning processing. Based on the above considerations, the present study aims to explore the auditory reference valence effects of affective S–R compatibility.\n\nMethod\nParticipants\nTwenty-three college students between the ages of 18 and 20 (M = 19.0 years, SD = 0.71, 11 women and 12 men) participated in the experiment. All participants were Chinese speakers. All participants were right-handed and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision (auditory). All participants provided their written informed consent to participate in this study. The study was approved by the academic and ethics committee of school of education in Anqing Normal College. The academic and ethics committees approved this consent procedure. YUE FEI fought against the Jin race and became a national hero of the Chinese history. Before his departure to defend his country against the Jin army, his mother the tattooed four characters ‘jin zhong bao guo’ on his back to encourage him to serve his homeland with loyalty. QIN HUI is one of the ten biggest traitors in the history of China because he had YUE FEI executed for an ‘unwarranted’ count; an act which left a smell for ten thousand years. Thus, the reference objects for this experiment were YUE FEI and QIN HUI. All participants were familiar with the ancient Chinese characters (YUE FEI and QIN HUI) of which YUE FEI and QIN HUI were characteristic. All participants had clearly good and bad evaluations for YUE FEI and QIN HUI, respectively.\n\n\nMaterials\nA computer was used to present stimulus and record keyboard response. A 17-inch HPL1908w CRT computer monitor with 1440×900 resolution, true colour, and 60 Hz refresh rate was used. All experiment materials were presented through the DMDX stimulus presentation system. The sizes of the stimulus materials had default values. Distance to the screen was about 60 cm. The experiment material was Chinese material. There were 16 personality adjectives in the experiment. Each of the adjective was composed of 3–5 characters. The 16 personality adjectives were from factors of 16PF scale. Before the formal experiment, experimenter asked for informal participants to assess the adjectives in order to distinct them into positive and negative. In each group experiments, half of the adjective is positive (16), half of the adjective is negative (16).\nRecords of auditory experiment materials were produced by man using mandarin. Before formal experiment, the participants need to identify the contents of the tape recording and confirm that they can understand the recording materials. The auditory experiment materials embedded in the DMDX procedure. Auditory materials (taking up 1500 ms time) were played through mini sound box, which standed at the central position in front of computer. The experiment was conducted with the participants inside a moderately bright laboratory. The screen background was white, while visual stimulation was black (fixation point is black ‘+’).\n\n\nDesign\nThe conducted study was a 2 (gender: male vs. female) × 3 (presentation mode: visual words vs. visual pictures vs. auditory stimuli) × 2 (reference objects: YUE FEI vs. QIN HUI) × 2 (valence of stimulate: positive vs. negative) × 2 (direction of movement: approach vs. avoidance) mixed design experiment. Gender was a between-group variable; the rest were within-group variables. The dependent variable was RT. Because all of the factors in the analysis except gender were within-subject manipulations, the design was adequately powered to detect medium-to-small effect sizes.\n\n\nProcedure\nExperimental flow diagrams are presented in Figs. 1 to 6. All of the experimental materials were presented through the DMDX stimulus presentation system, which includes 6 subsystems with the same test frequency of 32. In the experiment, when a tip-stimulated black ‘+’ appeared within 500 ms, the subjects were instructed to focus on the screen. The test stimulus appeared at 2000 ms. The participants were asked to respond by pressing the arrow key within 3000 ms. After showing an empty screen for an additional 1000 ms, the system ran the next experimental item. The Group 1 condition tested a consistent pattern based on visual words. A reference name appeared on the center of the screen, and a corresponding personality adjective appeared on either the left or the right side of the reference name. To distinguish between the two levels of valence of stimuli, the study set up personality adjectives (positive or negative), reference objects, and movement adjectives to determine consistent effect reaction times for the different directions of movement. When YUE FEI and a commendatory word appeared, the subjects were asked to click the arrow (starting from the personality adjective) pointed toward YUE FEI (for instance, in ‘YUE FEI Intelligent’, the instruction was to press the ‘←’ key). Approach or avoidance action was reflected in the ‘←’ key or ‘→’ key responses. The computer automatically recorded the reaction time. When the screen presented YUE FEI and a derogatory word, the subjects were asked to click the arrow directed away from YUE FEI. When the screen presented QIN HUI and a commendatory word, the subjects were expected to click the arrow (from the personality adjective) pointed away from QIN HUI. When QIN HUI and a derogatory word were presented, the subjects were asked to click the arrow (from the personality adjective) pointed toward QIN HUI. A practice module was used prior to the formal experiment. After the first group experiment, subjects were asked to take a two-minute break. The Group 2 condition tested an inconsistent pattern based on visual words. When the screen presented a combination of YUE FEI and a commendatory word, the subjects were asked to click the arrow directed away from YUE FEI (for example, in ‘YUE FEI intelligent’, the instruction was to press the ‘→’ key). When YUE FEI and a derogatory word appeared, the subjects were expected to click the arrow pointed toward YUE FEI. When QIN HUI and a commendatory word appeared, subjects were asked to click the arrow pointed toward QIN HUI. When QIN HUI and a derogatory word were presented, the subjects were asked to click the arrow directed away from QIN HUI. The Group 3 condition tested a consistent pattern based on visual pictures. A picture of the reference object was displayed on the screen, and a corresponding personality adjective appeared on either the left or the right side of the picture. Reaction model is similar to group 1. The Group 4 condition tested an inconsistent pattern based on visual pictures. A picture of the reference object appeared on the screen, and a corresponding personality adjective appeared on either the left or the right side of the picture. Reaction model is similar to group 2. The Group 5 condition tested a consistent pattern based on auditory stimuli. The pronunciation of the name of the reference object appeared in the center of the screen, and a corresponding personality adjective appeared at either the left or the right of this pronunciation. Reaction model is similar to group 1. The Group 6 condition tested an inconsistent pattern based on audition. The pronunciation of the name of a reference object was displayed in the center of the screen, and a corresponding personality adjective appeared at either the left or the right side of the pronunciation. Reaction model is similar to group 2. To eliminate the order effect, all experimental conditions were conducted randomly.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.

RT of presentation mode.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0095085.t001The result shows that the presentation mode (F (2, 42) = 925.32, p<.001, Partial η2 = .98) has a significant effect on RT. The results show that the interaction between the presentation mode and the reference object (F (2, 42) = 3.42, p<.05, Partial η2 = .14) also has significant effects on RT. The interactions among the presentation mode, the reference object, and gender (F (2, 42) = 5.54, p<.01, Partial η2 = .21) have significant effects on RT as well. The same holds true for the interaction between the presentation mode and the valence of stimulus (F (2, 42) = 26.07, p<.001, Partial η2 = .55) and the interaction between the presentation mode and the direction of the arrow (F (2, 42) = 4.11, p<.05, Partial η2 = .16). Post-hoc analyses indicated significant differences in the levels of the presentation mode (RT audition>RT visual words>RT visual pictures). In the analysis of simple effects, presentation mode had a significant impact on YUE FEI (p<.001), the positive valence (p<.001), and the approach direction (p<.001). A t-test based on visual pictures showed that the average compatibility effect was significantly different from zero, t (22) = 2.43, p<.05 (M = 485 ms). Based on visual pictures, the RT of the approach behavioral tendency (M = 1211 ms) was faster than the avoidance behavioral tendency (M = 1432 ms) when YUE FEI matched a positive word or QIN HUI matched a negative word.\nPerceptions of emotional content depend on auditory and visual cues [29]–[30], [32]. Visual stimuli have an affective stimulus–response (S–R) compatibility effect. The present study examined whether auditory stimuli has the same affective stimulus–response (S–R) compatibility effect as visual stimuli. The results suggest that the presentation mode has a significant effect on RT. The personality characteristics of the participants were considered in the study. As YUE FEI is a positive representation of character, individuals usually paid attention to their own good personality characteristics. Thus, the volunteers participated in the cognitive aspect of the YUE FEI evaluation. Cognitive processing was more reflected in the three combinations of a good personality that included YUE FEI, participants, and the experimental material. In evaluating QIN HUI, the cognitive processing of the participants was shortened. As long as information relating to QIN HUI was available, the individual possessed a certain mindset that QIN HUI and positive information could not be associated. Zhang proposed a meaning-spelling theory of Chinese characters, and stressed that Chinese characters made full use of the human brain's visual processing power. Compared to the alphabet, Chinese characters form more thorough, visual words. Chinese characters are considered more than mere tools for recording [33]. The analysis of visual pictures is reflective of a strong performance in visual processing power. Thus, the RT of visual pictures in the present study was the fastest. The results show that the presentation mode has a significant effect on RT, thereby necessitating auditory research. Significant differences exist in the levels of the presentation mode (RT audition>RT visual words>RT visual pictures). Auditory stimuli add more to the cognition composition and are a type of meaning and serial processing. For auditory stimuli, the perception process of participants is successively. The study of spatial S–R compatibility of visual and auditory signals found that responses to visual signals were faster than those to auditory signal [34]. Their research further confirmed this point of view [35]. In some ways, these studies have consistency. In the visual experiment, the RT for word processing was slower than that for picture processing. This study agrees with the results of Zhang on one aspect, as their experimental material was also visual pictures [3], and indirectly supports the meaning-spelling theory of Chinese Characters [33].The average compatibility effect was calculated, and a t-test based on visual pictures showed that it was significantly different from zero. However, the t-test also showed no significant difference for visual words (298 ms) or auditory stimuli (−243 ms). The compatibility effect value of auditory stimuli was the smallest. A smaller compatibility effect existed when switching the presentation mode from visual stimuli to auditory stimuli. This study found an interesting phenomenon in that the only significant compatibility effect for visual pictures was for Chinese. There are differences between the results of the present study and those of previous studies; therefore, more research is necessary to further validate these results.In a previous study, the target and the referent matched (Einstein and positive words, Hitler and negative words), approach was faster avoidance [3]. This study found that the approach behavioral tendency was faster than the avoidance behavioral tendency when a positive character matched a positive adjective or a negative character matched a negative adjective. The study was also confined to the research category of visual pictures. More research in this area is also necessary for further validation.As a keyboard was used to input experimental reaction in the study, some limitations may be present. Further study can use a real approach and avoidance action to conduct related research (such as placing circuit boards at the feet, when participants perform approach and avoidance actions; the connection of the reaction device to the circuit board collects relevant data and reaction type). The reference valence effects in the study of affective S–R compatibility by Augmented Reality (AR) technology can improve the ecological validity of the study (the immersive feeling from registered, calibration, tracking, and fusion technologies allow participants to pay more attention to the real psychological reaction)."

                "\nRideability, i.e. the ease and comfort with which a horse can be ridden, is considered to be one of the most important traits in riding horses. However, at present rideability is evaluated rather subjectively in breeding horse performance tests. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role horse behaviour as well as degree and quality of rein tension might play in judges’ evaluation of horses’ rideability. Mares (n = 33) and stallions (n = 13) from two different mare- and one stallion-testing station were observed twice during their performance test dressage training. During these rides, rein tension was measured continuously, and frequency of behaviour patterns such as head-tossing, tail swishing, and snorting was recorded. Rein tension parameters showed reasonable repeatabilities within horse-rider pairs (e.g. mean rein tension: r2 = 0.61±0.11; variance of rein tension: r2 = 0.52±0.14). Regression analysis revealed that a larger proportion of variance in rideability scores could be explained by maximum (17%), mean (16%) and variance (15%) of rein tension compared to horses’ or riders’ behavioural parameters (tail-swishing: 5% and rider’s use of hands: 5%, respectively). According to mixed model analysis, rideability scores dropped (all P<0.05) with increasing mean, maximum and variability in rein tension (e.g. −0.37±0.14 scores per additional 10 Newton in mean tension). However, mean rein tension differed between testing stations (P<0.0001) ranging between 9.1±1.6 N in one station and 21.7±1.3 N in another station. These results indicate that quantity and consistency of rein tension is either directly or indirectly an important factor for judges to derive rideability scores. Given the importance of rein tension parameters to both rider comfort and horse welfare, potentially, measurements of rein tension along with behaviour observations assessing the quality of rein contact (e.g. distinguishing a light contact from attempts to evade contact) might be used to make the assessment of rideability more impartial.\n"

            "fulltext": "IntroductionRideability is a trait evaluated in a large proportion of horse breeding programmes (e.g. [1]). Rideability describes the degree of comfort a rider feels when riding a horse and the ease with which a horse can be ridden [2]–[4]. Although the level and quality of prior training can considerably influence rideability [4], during performance tests judges aim at assessing the horses’ innate aptitude rather than the level of rideability achieved by training. Besides the rider’s legs, seat and in some cases the voice, the reins are one of the main means of communication between rider and horse, and it is thus expected that the horse’s reaction to rider’s cues via these different channels largely determines its rideablity. The trait rideability is rated to be one of the most important traits by both riders [5] and breeders [6] of various riding horse breeds. Breeding associations take great efforts to evaluate the trait rideability. Exclusively for the trait rideability, external, independent test-riders are hired for each performance test to ride and evaluate the horses in addition to the evaluations taken in the training and test under the regular riders. However, based on the above definition, it becomes obvious that rideability is a very complex trait. Furthermore, a rider’s “feeling” is by definition a subjective experience, making the evaluation of this trait subjective. Although traditionally considered to be a performance rather than a personality trait [3], it is suggested that a horse’s rideability is also largely influenced by its sensitivity to the rider’s aids, its inclination to behave in certain ways and thus by its personality [4]. Learning ability, i.e. a component of personality, is also suggested to contribute to rideability [7]. Indeed many officially appointed judges and breeding authorities consider rideability to be a personality trait, too [4]. Therefore, rideability likely is a compound trait that comprises both conformation and personality aspects. For example, it can be assumed that a well-balanced horse, with long pasterns, a long neck and a slender throatlatch will likely be able to respond quickly and correctly to its rider’s requests, make the rider feel comfortable due to smooth gaits, and be physically less able to resist rein pressure. In the same way, a horse that is based on its genetic predisposition relaxed, with a medium sensitivity to tactile stimuli and that is quick to learn and to respond to riders’ aids will be supple and likewise be more comfortable to ride compared to one that is slow in learning and responding, tense, or that frequently spooks due to heightened fearfulness. As frequently pointed out, there is considerable room for improvement with personality trait evaluation in sport horse breeding programmes [8]–[12]. Rideability and personality traits are evaluated in breeding programmes based on subjective assessment methods [1], [12], leading to inflated and biased scores with limited variation between individuals [12], [13]. Based on these scores, a genetic selection appears to be unavailing. Perhaps due to its mixed status as a trait partially influenced by personality aspects and partially influenced by conformation aspects, the statistical distribution of rideability scores exhibits slightly more desirable properties compared to the conventional personality traits [12]. Nevertheless, more objective assessment methods could greatly improve the evaluation of rideability, ultimately enhancing genetic progress in this trait. For personality traits such as temperament or specifically fear reactivity, considerable effort has been put into the development of more objective assessment methods (see [14] for a review) such as direct behavioural observation during novel object tests [8], [10], [12], [15], [16], different riding situations [9], [17], handling situations [18] or veterinary inspections [19], [20]. However, with few recent exceptions [21], [22] comparably little attention has been paid to the trait rideability. Therefore, the objectives of the present work were to assess the relationship between conventional rideability scores and objective parameters, including the measurement of behaviour and rein tension, thereby providing insight into the mechanisms judges use to derive their evaluations of rideability. Furthermore, based on these relationships as well as repeatabilities, the suitability of these measurements for future, more objective rideability evaluation methods will be evaluated.\nMaterials and MethodsThis type of non-invasive, behavioural research is approved under the German animal protection act and does not require a study-specific permission. Owners (privately owned horses) or chief trainers of the testing stations (horses owned by the state stud) volunteered their horses to participate in the study. Except for equipping the horses with the rein tension device in addition to their normal tack all testing corresponded to the routine training procedures.\n\nAnimals and Testing Conditions\nA total of 46 German Riding Horses were observed for the present study. The majority of horses (n = 43) was the offspring of stallions licensed by one German breeding association, while three horses were the offspring of stallions licensed by another German breeding associations. All horses were participants of on-station mare (n = 2 stations; n = 33 mares) or stallion (n = 1 station; n = 13 stallions) performance tests, and they were either three (n = 35) or four (n = 11) years of age (table 1). They were housed for the duration of the performance test (mares: 4 weeks; stallions: 10 weeks) at the testing station in ca. 3×4 m individual box stalls with automatic drinkers and trained and/or turned out daily by the staff of the testing stations. Performance test guidelines suggest that horses should be well accustomed to carrying a saddle and a rider when entering the performance test. However, the level of training prior to the performance test remains at the discretion of the owners and was not known for the individual horses. During these on-station performance tests, horses are trained to be ridden in dressage and show-jumping and are evaluated for the basic gaits, jumping ability, rideability and the personality traits labelled “character”, “temperament” and “willingness to work” as well as “constitution” (stallion performance test only). Each trait is comprised of a variety of factors as described in more detail in the official evaluation guidelines [3] as well as previous studies [4], [23]. For example, rideability is supposed to be comprised of the rhythm and elasticity of the horse’s movement, its suppleness, posture, balance, reaction to the rider’s aids, the degree of chewing the bit, rein contact and the degree of comfort for the rider [3]. Each trait is graded on a scale from 1 (very poor) to 10 (excellent). Evaluation of these traits ensues in three steps: In the first step, the stations’ head coach grades the horses considering their performance during the 20–70 day training phase. In the second step, rideability, the gaits and jumping ability, but not the personality traits, are evaluated with the same scoring system in a 1-day final test, by a pair of external, certified judges appointed by the national equestrian federation. During the dressage test and the free-jumping parts of the final test horses are present by their regular rider they are familiar with from the training phase of the performance test. Also during this final test, in a third step an additional judge, i.e. a test rider likewise appointed by the national equestrian federation rides each horse for a brief period of 2–5 minutes in order to assign a third score for rideability only. Thus, rideability is judged twice by judges from the ground observing the horses’ performance under their familiar rider, and once by a judge mounting the horse, directly evaluating how easy and comfortable the horse is to ride. Horses’ final scores for rideability are the arithmetic mean of the scores from the three steps. Horses’ final scores for the performance traits are calculated by assigning double weight to scores from the final test and subsequently taking the mean of the training and final test scores. Horses were ridden during training and the final test by 15 different riders with a maximum of 8 horses per rider (n = 1 rider) and a minimum of 1 horse per rider (n = 4 riders). The judges differed for the three testing stations.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 1.

Training was conducted for a mean (±SD) duration of 17.3±3.3 min. per day and included basic exercises such as transitions between gaits, and riding of simple dressage figures, such as circles or patterns leading to a change in hand.\n\n\nData Collection\nEach horse was observed twice during two dressage training sessions of the performance test. In accordance with an earlier study [9], the frequency of different behaviour patterns in both horse and rider were recorded per ride and converted on a per-hour-basis (table 2). In order to minimize subjectivity by introducing additional interpretations, behaviour patterns were recorded irrespective of their context. Teeth-grinding was observed, but not included in the further analysis due to occurrence in just two horses. Crabbing was likewise included in the ethogram, but no instances were observed. In contrast to the earlier study [9], observations were taken live, and only one horse at a time was observed. In addition, the observed horse was equipped during both rides with a rein tension meter (Signal Scribe, Crafted Technology, Australia), and rein tension was recorded to the inbuilt data logger. Before and after the full set of measurements per location, sensors of the rein tension device were calibrated using weights of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 kg, and no creep was detected. Official scores for all traits evaluated in the performance test were obtained from the testing stations after conclusion of the test.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 2.  List and description of observed behaviour patterns recorded in frequencies of occurrence in the horse and rider (adapted from [9]).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0087285.t002\n\nStatistical Analysis\nRein tension data was processed with the manufacturer-specific software and later analyzed along with the behavioural data and scores from performance tests using SAS (version 9.2). Mean, maximum and variance of rein tension was calculated for each ride separately, but combined for the right and left rein, and in addition, the absolute and relative difference between left and right rein mean tension was calculated as a measure of asymmetry of the horse-rider pair. All data were tested for distribution using the procedure UNIVARIATE. Traits that did not resemble a normal distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov: P<0.01) were analysed assuming either a Poisson distribution or, in the case of rare occurrences (i.e. occurrences in less than 15 rides and no more than 3 occurrences per ride) data were converted into binary data (e.g. bucking/no bucking observed per ride; see table 3).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 3.  Frequencies per hour of riding of observed behaviour patterns as well as the type of data distribution assumed for analysis and the respective repeatabilities (±SE) of behaviour and rein tension parameters considering either the horse-rider dyad or rider only as random factor.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0087285.t003Mean ± SD of rideability and personality trait scores were calculated along with the Pearson correlation coefficients between these different traits. Subsequently, scores for the personality traits character, temperament and willingness-to-work (excluding the trait constitution due to unavailability of these scores for the mares as well as doubts in how far this trait is indeed a personality rather than health-related trait [4]) as well as rideability were analysed using a linear regression. For this regression a step-wise selection procedure was used to identify, based on the coefficient of determination, of all behavioural and rein tension variables (listed in table 3) those explaining the largest proportion of variance in the respective dependent variable. In addition in a next step, mixed models (parametric data) or generalized linear mixed models (non-parametric data) with a logit link (binary data) or log link (Poisson data) function was used to analyse the effect of categorical factors (horse age [3 or 4 years old], horse gender, location, measurement number [first or second observation], binary behavioural data) as well as the five most influential continuous factors (based on the coefficient of determination from the prior regression analysis) on personality scores. Variables were removed from the model, if they were not significant, and due to their partial confounding, horse gender and location were not considered simultaneously, but one after the other in the analysis. Rein tension and behaviour parameters were analyzed in the same manner. Results from these analyses are presented only, if they were, or tended to be, significant at the P<0.05 or P<0.1 level. To obtain variance components, either horse-rider pairs or only riders were considered in separate runs as a random factor, thus accounting for repeated observations per horse-rider pair or per rider. These variance components were used to calculate repeatabilities on the original scale (normally distributed data [24]) or on the latent scale (Poisson and binary distributed data [25]) for the behavioural and rein tension parameters at the rider as well as the horse-rider pair level. Standard errors of repeatabilities were calculated based on the approximation described e.g. by Roberds and Strom [26]. For the normally distributed traits, significance of random effects was assessed using Chi-Square statistics based on differences in log likelihoods of the mixed models with or without the respective random factor [27]. Due to lacking comparability of log Pseudo-likelihoods of different generalized mixed models, these calculations were not conducted for the non-Gaussian data.\n\nResults\nDescriptive Statistics and Correlations of Performance Test Scores\nThe participating horses received in the performance test a mean ± SD rideability score of 7.75±0.65. Scores for the other personality traits were: overall personality = 8.09±0.61, temperament = 8.02±0.41, character = 7.99±0.58, willingness to work = 7.65±0.73, and constitution = 7.88±0.57. Correlation coefficients between rideability and overall personality (r = 0.69; P<0.0001), temperament (r = 0.50; P = 0.0021), character (r = 0.60; P = 0.0001), willingness-to-work (r = 0.56; P = 0.0004) and constitution scores (r = 0.35; P = 0.27) were mostly high and significant. Correlation coefficients among the different personality traits were, again except for the trait constitution, likewise highly significant (P<0.0043) and ranged between 0.44 (temperament – willingness-to-work) and 0.85 (overall personality – character).\n\n\nRepeatability of Rein Tension and Behavioural Parameters\nRepeatabilities of rein tension parameters were both at the horse*rider level as well as at the rider level within an acceptable range, but repeatabilities varied widely for the behaviour traits (table 3).\n\n\nVariance Explained in Rideability and Personality Trait Scores\nThe regression analysis revealed that a considerable proportion of variance in rideability scores could be explained by rein tension and behavioural parameters. Notably, the three main rein tension parameters (coefficient of determination for maximum tension: 17%, mean rein tension: 16%, and variability of rein tension: 15%) each explained a larger proportion of variance in rideability scores, compared to any behavioural parameter. The maximum value for behavioural parameters was 5% for tail-swishing as well as for rider’s use of hands and horse-induced change in gait, followed by shying (4%). Albeit the overall variance explained was lower, a similar pattern was observed with the willingness to work scores: mean, variance and maximum rein tension explained 9%, 9% and 8% of the variance, respectively, while the three most influential behaviour patterns explained only 4% (involuntary change in gait) or 3% (both snorting and rider’s use of legs) of the variance in willingness to work scores. In contrast, scores for the trait temperament were best explained by the frequency of shying per hour of riding (19%), while maximum rein tension explained a considerably lower proportion of variance (6%), followed by tail-swishing, snorting and the rider’s use of the whip (each 4%). Variance in rein tension explained the largest proportion (12%) of variance in character scores, followed by involuntary change in gait (10%), mean rein tension (9%) and maximum rein tension as well as shying (both 8%).\n\n\nInfluence of Behaviour and Rein Tension on Rideability and Personality Trait Scores\nRideability scores dropped significantly (all P<0.05) with increasing mean, maximum and variability in rein tension (e.g. −0.37±0.14 scores per additional 1 Newton in mean tension; table 4). In addition, rideability scores tended to drop with increasing frequencies of behaviour patterns such as tail-swishing and shying (table 4).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 4.  Influence of behaviour patterns and rein tension parameters on scores for personality traits.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0087285.t004\n\nOther Factors Influencing Rideability Scores, Rein Tension or Behaviour\nThe random horse*rider effect was significant (P<0.05) for mean and difference in rein tension, indicating that there are considerable differences between horse-rider pairs in the intensity and consistency of tension placed on the rein by the horse and/or the rider. Similarly, the random rider effect was significant for the mean and difference in rein tension, indicating that rein tension is also considerably determined by the rider’s riding style independent of the horse. Mean, maximum and variance of rein tension differed highly significantly between testing stations (P<0.0001) ranging e.g. between a least square mean of 9.1±1.6 N in one station and 18.9±0.9 N and 21.7±1.3 N in the other two stations (table 5). Horses that snorted had lower mean rein tensions than horses that did not snort (P = 0.0074), while rein tension increased as the performance test training progressed: there were lower (P<0.0001) rein tensions observed in the first compared to the second measurement (table 5).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 5.  Factors influencing rein tension parameters.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0087285.t005With the exception of bucking, horses’ behaviour was considerably influenced either by the riders’ behaviour and/or rein tension parameters (table 6). In particular, the rider’s use of legs and whip influence a large number of horses’ behaviour patterns. In addition, horse behaviour differed in a few cases by horse gender: stallions were less likely to show tail-swishing (0.95±0.47 times less likely to tail-swish; P = 0.0511) and head-tossing (1.55±0.61 times less likely to toss their head; P = 0.0154) compared to mares. However, the partial confounding of gender with location needs to be kept in mind with these results. There were also considerable relationships between the different behaviour patterns. Horses that shied were also more likely to show horse-induced changes in pace (2.9±0.41 time more likely; P<0.0001) and head-tossing (1.9±0.49 times more likely; P = 0.0004), and they were less likely to attempt to buck (5.0±1.1 times less likely; P<0.0001), compared to horses that did not shy during the observation period. Also, the more often horses tossed their head, the more likely they were to show a horse-induced change in gait (0.05±0.007; P<0.0001) and to tail-swish (0.03±0.006; P<0.0001). Similarly, the more often a horse swished its tail, the more likely it was to head-toss (0.03±0.006; P<0.0001), and the less likely it was to snort (−0.06±0.03; P = 0.0578) and to stumble (−0.07±0.03; P = 0.0246). Horse’s age did not significantly influence any of the behaviour patterns, although the limited number of four-year-olds does not allow for definite conclusions.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 6.  Influence of rider behaviour and rein tension on horses’ behavioural parameters.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0087285.t006\nThe traits rideability, temperament, character and willingness-to-work are compound traits with rather vague definitions, each including a large variety of different behaviour patterns. Evaluations of these traits based on scores that classify an animal’s performance in these traits as either “good” or “poor” by different judges that may each have their own set of aspects they focus on during evaluation will thus make it impossible to infer definite, specific behaviour profiles from the scores alone. The present study nevertheless attempted to shed light on some general relationships between rideability and personality trait scores on the one hand and specific behaviour patterns and rein tension parameters on the other hand. Results revealed that the lower and the steadier the rein tension the better judges evaluated horses’ rideability, i.e. the measure of how comfortable it feels to ride a certain horse. Most riding theories request a steady but light contact between the horse’s mouth and the rider’s hand via the reins (e.g. [28]). Also, according to the guidelines [3] as well as a survey, rideability is considered by performance test judges to be partially determined by the intensity and consistency of the rein contact [4]. Thus the relationships between rein tension parameters detected in the present study were expected, and they indicate that performance test judges apparently indeed pay attention to signs indicative of the quality and intensity of rein tension. On the other hand, the rather strong relationships between rein tension and rideability scores are also surprising as riders and judges do not always seem to be particularly good in judging their own rein tension [29] or in agreeing on the lightness of riders’ aids [30], respectively. In addition, the insufficiencies of the current rideability and personality evaluation methods have been highlighted repeatedly [4], [7], [12], [31], and therefore, the identified relationships may not be particularly meaningful. For example, these relationships may not exist when using a different set of judges. However, rideability scores from the performance test are an accepted measurement in practice and are at present the only available data on this parameter. In future studies it would be interesting to consider the individual scores assigned by the coach, the judge from the ground and the test rider separately to investigate potential differences in their evaluation strategies.The present study is the first to report repeatabilities of rein tension and behavioural parameters assessed in the ridden horse both at the rider as well as the horse-rider level. Repeatabilities for rein tension parameters and some, but not all behavioural parameters were remarkably high, and within similar ranges for horse-rider pairs as well as riders. However, the sample size of the present study was small, and it would be important to confirm the results in a larger sample of horses. Repeatabilities for the rein tension parameters compare well to values for horses’ reactivity in standardized temperament tests [12] as well as to performance parameters [32], [33]. Therefore, these moderately to highly repeatable traits potentially qualify for future, large-scale investigations such as are required for the estimation of genetic parameters. Furthermore, considering both the comparably high repeatabilities of rein tensions parameters and the relation between rein tension parameters and rideability scores, results from the present study indicate that the evaluation of at least some aspects of rideability could be made more objective, if direct measures of rein tension were taken instead of subjective scores. However, rein tension parameters alone will not be sufficient as it is not possible based on the plain values to distinguish a desired, very light rein contact from horses’ avoidance of rein contact (i.e. the horse going “behind the bit”). Additional recording of the horses’ behaviour and head posture will be indispensable for proper interpretation of the rein tension measurements.Furthermore, at the present stage, the technical equipment may not yet be robust enough, and in general dependence on the technical equipment may be prohibitive for introduction in performance tests. For example in an earlier version of this experiment, no rein tension measurements could be obtained as the rein gauges broke within minutes of testing the first horse due to overload of the sensors which had a maximum capacity of 50 N. Although more powerful sensors (maximum capacity of 100 N) were used for the present experiment, and no further problems disturbed the measurements of the present study, this incidence of equipment failure serves as an example of the susceptibility of technical, equipment-based measurements to data loss. Other potential sources of data loss include failure of power supply, memory card, or hardware, and these potential sources of data loss must be minimized before performance test evaluations can be replaced by technological devices. Alternative solutions such as the subjective assessment of rein tension by specifically trained judges, or the use of indicator traits such as rein length [34] may not yield satisfactory results either. Continued reliance on judges’ evaluations would not overcome the problems inherent to subjective evaluations [4], and rein length is a parameter influenced directly and almost unilaterally by the rider and may thus not be suitable to evaluate horses’ innate characteristics.Lower proportions of variance in rideability scores explained by behaviour patterns in the present study compared to the previous study [9] may be a result of different judges evaluating the traits at the different locations. It is likely that, due to the rather subjective evaluation criteria [4] along with the large amount of individual factors that comprise the present, complex traits, each judge has her/his own aspects she or he focuses on during evaluation of personality traits as well as rideability. Combining the results from these different judges will thus lower the impact of relationships that exist within parameters evaluated by one judge. In addition, these values have to be seen in light of the suboptimal statistical properties of both the behavioural parameters as well as the rideability scores [13]. Direct comparisons between e.g. behaviour and rein tension parameters with different distributions suboptimal for regression analysis should be considered with care, and if there is overall little variance present, it may be easier to explain a significant proportion of this limited variance. Means and standard deviations for rideability (7.8±0.7) and personality scores (e.g. temperament: 8.0±0.4) were similar to scores obtained in the recent past by larger groups of performance tested horses in Poland [7] between 2004 and 2007 or in Germany (7.8±0.9 and 8.3±0.8 for temperament and rideability, respectively between 2007 and 2010 [13]). The high, phenotypic correlations found in the present study between the different personality traits are also typical of performance test scores [12]. Therefore, the horses used in the present study appear to be a representative sample of the general participants of performance tests. These high correlations between the different personality trait scores once again highlight the insufficiencies of the present personality trait evaluation system, and also explain why a larger number of behaviour and rein tension traits in present study simultaneously explain significant amounts of variation in different personality traits (e.g. rein tension parameters significantly influence rideability scores as well as overall personality scores and character scores [see table 5]).Mean rein tension is with ca. 9–20 N comparable to results from earlier studies investigating similar riding situations [35]–[39]. However, mean rein tension in all these studies was remarkably high and considerably higher than the tension young horses would accept voluntarily (ca. 6–10 N; [40]). Thus, not surprisingly, in the present as well as in the above-mentioned study [40] higher rein tensions were associated with higher levels of potential conflict behaviour such as horse-induced change in gait [36], and with lower levels of potential comfort behaviour such as snorting. More frequent shying was also associated with higher mean and maximum rein tension, although as with any of these statistical relationships cause and effect are not clear. Possibly, riders tried to restrain horses more strongly after they shied, but possibly, horses ridden with stronger rein contact were more fearful and thus showed shying more frequently. Such an enhancing effect of more coercive riding techniques was shown earlier [41] and may be the result of additive effects of anxiety on fear reactions [42]. In contrast, the frequency of head-tossing tended to be reduced with increasing mean and maximum rein tensions, potentially because the high rein pressure physically prevented the horses from exhibiting any potential discomfort or avoidance behaviour via head movements for fear of yet increasing the pressure in the mouth. Ineffectiveness of or inability to express avoidance behaviour has the potential to provoke a state of learnt helplessness [43]. In this context heightened rein tensions potentially have to be considered as a severe threat to equine welfare. A stronger focus on the evaluation of rein tension during horse shows appears to be a logical step to advocate the ridden horses’ welfare.Differences between rein tension in left and right reins likely are the combined result of horses’ and riders’ laterality [35]. Minimizing lateralisation is an important aspect in training of young horses, which is why associations with personality evaluations were expected, but not confirmed by the present study. The association between absolute difference in rein tension and shying potentially relates to horses’ emotional laterality, i.e. their preferences for a certain eye when observing frightening objects [44].Striking differences in mean, maximum and variance in rein tension between test stations indicate that there may be differences in “riding culture” maintained e.g. by the head coach, that lead to marked differences in the amount of force applied on the reins. Differences in individual riders’ riding styles, e.g. regarding the differences in their use of visible hand aids and the use of whips further support this view. Although the confounding of gender with locations makes conclusions regarding these effects difficult, generally the location appears to play the more important role. With more parameters, one of the two mare stations rather than the stallion station differed significantly from the other two locations. Such differences in local “riding culture” were also observed for different riding schools [45], but are nevertheless surprising in the present study: performance tests should provide as much as possible standardized training conditions in order to allow for an unbiased assessment of the animals’ genetic merit. Thus, those factors clearly need to be standardized or controlled for, when using rein tension measurements in evaluation of horses’ rideability. Furthermore, the significant influence of the rider as well as the horse-rider pair underlined that mean rein tension is determined by both the horse and the rider. Likewise, the considerable influence of riders’ behaviour on horses’ behaviour demonstrates that riders indirectly have an impact on horses’ evaluation in the performance test. Repeated evaluation of rideability under different riders would have been interesting to further shed light on the influence the rider has on rideability evaluations. However, due to the study’s set up within the official performance test training, it was not possible to change training conditions by using different riders per horse. The continued use of independent test riders, whose individual level of rein tension and intensity of aids will be known from repeated observations and can thus be corrected for as is the case during genetic evaluations based on sport horse data [46], could be a potential solution. Nevertheless, interaction effects between specific horses and riders also exist, such that a given horse-rider combination matches particularly well or poorly and will thus yield particularly low or high values in rein tension. Unfortunately, such interaction effects that could indicate which type of horse is particularly suitable for a certain type of rider/riding style could only be tested reliably in a very large number of horses ridden by several different riders. The routine evaluation by two different test riders during the performance test would be an important step into this direction.Overall, the results of the present study confirm the insufficiencies of the present personality and rideability evaluation system in horse breeding. The vague definitions of very complex traits do not allow for objective and transparent evaluations. This is also reflected by a lack of associations between behaviour patterns that should, according to the guidelines, be related to rideability. Defining a precise list of behaviour patterns whose frequencies can be counted or whose intensities can be measured is an important step towards an improvement of the situation. However, in order to assign meaning to such measurements the specific context of behaviour patterns may have to be considered, which is a limitation of the present study. Although performance tests are intended to solely evaluate the animals’ abilities, the present study supports common knowledge that riders considerably influence the horses’ traits. These findings highlight the importance that the rider’s actions need to be recorded, too. These record would allow for both evaluation of the horse’s reaction to the rider’s aids as well as statistical corrections for the influence of the rider’s riding style when evaluating horse’s rideability. Ultimately such a revised evaluation system would allow breeders to make more informed decisions when selecting stallions for their mares based on rideability aspects."
