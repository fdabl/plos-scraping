                "\nDue to environmental persistence and biotoxicity of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), it is urgent to develop potential technologies to remediate PBDEs. Introducing electrodes for microbial electricity generation to stimulate the anaerobic degradation of organic pollutants is highly promising for bioremediation. However, it is still not clear whether the degradation of PBDEs could be promoted by this strategy. In this study, we hypothesized that the degradation of PBDEs (e.g., BDE-209) would be enhanced under microbial electricity generation condition. The functional compositions and structures of microbial communities in closed-circuit microbial fuel cell (c-MFC) and open-circuit microbial fuel cell (o-MFC) systems for BDE-209 degradation were detected by a comprehensive functional gene array, GeoChip 4.0, and linked with PBDE degradations. The results indicated that distinctly different microbial community structures were formed between c-MFCs and o-MFCs, and that lower concentrations of BDE-209 and the resulting lower brominated PBDE products were detected in c-MFCs after 70-day performance. The diversity and abundance of a variety of functional genes in c-MFCs were significantly higher than those in o-MFCs. Most genes involved in chlorinated solvent reductive dechlorination, hydroxylation, methoxylation and aromatic hydrocarbon degradation were highly enriched in c-MFCs and significantly positively correlated with the removal of PBDEs. Various other microbial functional genes for carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur cycling, as well as energy transformation process, were also significantly increased in c-MFCs. Together, these results suggest that PBDE degradation could be enhanced by introducing the electrodes for microbial electricity generation and by specifically stimulating microbial functional genes.\n"

            "fulltext": "IntroductionPolybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a class of flame retardants that have caused considerable concern in recent years due to their elevated levels of detection in the environment, particularly human tissues [1], [2]. Penta-BDE, octa-BDE and deca-BDE are three major commercial PBDE mixtures. The former two products have been included on the Stockholm convention list of priority persistent organic pollutants and banned from the European market since 2003 and effectively eliminated in North America since 2005 [3]. However, deca-BDE, which is mainly composed of deca-BDE (BDE-209) and a small amount of nona-BDEs, accounts for approximately 83% of the worldwide use of PBDEs, and is still legally used in most countries. As a result, BDE-209 was detected as the substantially dominant PBDE congeners in sediment environments [4]. Recent studies demonstrated that BDE-209 could be anaerobically debrominated by microorganisms [5], [6], [7]. However, the degradation of these highly persistent halogenated compounds is very slow and always produces toxic lower brominated PBDE congeners under anaerobic conditions [8].\nIt has been reported that the amendments of co-substrates [7], primer compounds [5] or electron donors [9] could stimulate PBDE biodebromination. However, the main problem for PBDE biodegradation is the low biomass and activity of the functional microbes. Researchers have found that the lack of suitable electron acceptors was the main limitation for organic pollutant degradation under anaerobic condition and the supplementary of electron acceptors could even avoid the production of toxic daughter products by providing necessary electron flow to stimulate the viabilities of indigenous microorganisms [10]. Under aerobic conditions, oxygen is the preferential electron acceptor. However, under anaerobic conditions, electron acceptors are usually limited and the microbial metabolic activities are depressed. In order to stimulate indigenous microbial growth and activity/viabilities, alternative terminal electron acceptors to oxygen, such as nitrate, sulfate and ferric iron were employed in anaerobic bioremediation processes [10], [11]. With the development of microbial fuel cells (MFCs), electrodes were introduced as the solid terminal electron acceptor to stimulate anaerobic biodegradation [12], [13]. In the anode compartment of bioelectrochemical system (BES), microorganisms can respire with anode by converting the energy stored in chemical bonds in organic compounds to generate electricity. Such an electron transfer is highly promising for bioremediation of organic pollutants, such as petroleum hydrocarbons, wastewaters, and contaminated soils and sediments. More and more studies have demonstrated that electrodes can served as electron acceptors for stimulating the anaerobic degradation of organic pollutants in contaminated environments, including petroleum hydrocarbons [13], [14] and chlorinated compounds [15].\nSince the structures between polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and PBDEs are very similar, it is likely that some dechlorinating enzymes may be involved in PBDE transformation [16], [17]. However, little is known about the microbial transformation of PBDEs, especially enzymes necessary for PBDE biodegradation. Our previous studies found that the structure and composition of PBDE-degrading microbial communities could be affected by the environmental parameters, and that most commonly genera involved in PBDE degradation were anodic respiring bacteria, such as Geobacter, Shewenalla, and Pseudomonas [9], [18]. It is necessary to identify key functional genes and their associated populations involved in PBDE degradation so that an effective bioremediation strategy can be developed.\nIn this study, we hypothesized that the introduction of extra electron acceptor through the external circuit would stimulate the diversity and abundance of microbial communities and accelerate PBDE biodegradation. To test those hypotheses, two different operating modes were conducted in dual-chamber MFC systems, one operated under closed-circuit condition (c-MFC) and the other under open-circuit condition (o-MFC) as controls were designed for PBDE degradation. A functional gene array, GeoChip 4.0, which contains 120,054 distinct probes, covering 200,393 coding sequences (CDS) for genes in different processes, was used to examine the impacts of concomitant electricity production on the functional microbial community composition and structure, and the linkages between microbial community structures and PBDE degradation rates. Our results indicated that microbial electricity generation dramatically increased microbial community functional gene diversity and abundance, especially those genes involved in chlorinated solvent remediation and aromatic hydrocarbon degradation, which were correlated with BDE-209 degradation.\nMaterials and Methods\nReactor Setup and Operational Conditions\nTwo differently operating modes (closed-circuit and open-circuit) were conducted in dual-chamber MFC systems which were assembled as previously described [19]. The anodic compartments contained 200 ml of modified M9 medium supplemented with 20 mM lactate (electron donor) and 1.4 µM BDE-209. Prior to the addition of defined medium, BDE-209 resolved in dichloromethane was added to each anodic compartment and evaporated in the dark. The cathode compartments were filled with 200 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution containing 50 mM ferricyanide. The BDE-209-degrading enrichment [9] was inoculated to anodic chambers to start the c-MFC and o-MFC operation. All of the MFC systems were incubated at 30°C in the dark without agitation, after the anode compartments were purged with pure nitrogen gas for 5–10 min. Voltage output of the c-MFC under an 800 ohm external resistor was recorded every 4 min using a multimeter (UT71D, Uni-Trend Technology). Lactate was re-supplemented to the systems when the voltage in c-MFC decreased to its lowest value. Anodic cultures in these two kinds of MFC systems were periodically sampled and used for subsequent analyses. The concentrations of unbounded bromine ion in anodic culture were determined using an ion chromatography system (ICS1500, Ionpac AS19/AG19, Dionex) and a gradient KOH eluent (10 mM for 0–10 min, 10–45 mM for 10–25 min, 45 mM for 25–30 min, 10 mM for 30–37 min). After 70-day performance, BDE209-degrading rates and the PBDE congener profiles were analyzed as previously described [9]. In brief, the whole anodic chambers including the culture liquids and anodes were extracted with dichloromethane for 3 times. The resulting extracts were evaporated in a rotary evaporator and re-dissolved with n-hexane. PBDE congeners dissolved in n-hexane were then analyzed by a Shimadzu Model 2010 gas chromatograph (GC) coupled with a Model QP200 mass spectrometer (MS). Standard curves for the quantitative determination of PBDEs were prepared using a gas chromatograph-electron capture detection (GC-ECD).\nSample collections and the subsequent treatments were conducted in triplicate.\n\n\nDNA Preparation and GeoChip 4.0 Analysis\nDNA was extracted using the TIANamp Bacteria DNA Kit (TIANGEN BIOTECH (BEIJING) CO., LTD.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA amplification and labeling, as well as the purification of labeled DNA, were carried out according to the methods described by Xu et al. [20]. The GeoChip 4.0 synthesized by NimbleGen (Madison, WI, USA) was used to analyze the functional structure of the microbial communities. All hybridizations were carried out at 42°C with 40% formamide for 16 h on a MAUI hybridization station (BioMicro, Salt Lake City, UT, USA). After hybridization, the arrays were scanned with a NimbleGen MS200 microarray scanner (Roche NimbleGen, Madison, 113 WI, USA) at a laser power of 100% and 100% PMT (photomultiplier tube). Signal intensities were measured based on scanned images, and spots with signal-to-noise ratios lower than 2 were removed before statistical analysis as described previously [21].\n\n\nStatistical Analysis\nPre-processed GeoChip data were further analyzed with different statistical methods: (i) cluster analysis was performed using the pairwise average-linkage hierarchical clustering algorithm in the CLUSTER software (http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm) for microbial community structure and composition, and the results of hierarchical clustering were visualized using TREEVIEW software (http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm); (ii) principal component analysis (PCA) performed by CANOCO 4.5 for Windows (Biometris – Plant Research International, The Netherlands), and three different non-parametric analyses performed with the Vegan package (v.1.17–12) in R v. 2.13.1 (R Development Core Team, 2011): analysis of similarities (ANOSIM), non-parametric multivariate analysis of variance (Adonis) and Multi-Response Permutation Procedure (MRPP), were conducted to determine the overall functional gene changes in the microbial communities; (iii) microbial diversity index analyzed by Krebs/win version 0.94 (http://www.biology.ualberta.ca/jbrzusto/​krebswin.html), Significant Pearson’s linear correlation (r) analysis and analyses of variance (ANOVA) analyzed by SPSS 16.0 for Windows and response ratio (RR) (Data S1 in File S1) using the formula described by Luo et al. [22] for identifying the genes with significant change; (iv) canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) for revealing the individual or set of environmental variables that significantly explained the variation in functional microbial communities [23], [24]; and (v) partial CCA were calculated using functional gene communities and PBDE congener compositions and hydrochemical parameters for each treatment as covariables. All the analyses were performed by functions in CANOCO 4.5 for Windows (Biometris – Plant Research International, The Netherlands).\n\nResults\nBioreactor Performance\nThe voltage of c-MFC under the external resistor increased to 0.41 V after 12 days performance, and was subsequently decreased with the consumption of electron donor. Supplement of lactate could immediately recover current generation. The maximum voltage increased from 0.41 V to 0.46 V in the first two current generation periods and then showed a slight decrease in the following periods (Figure S1A in File S1). Polarization analysis showed a maximum power density of 3.3 W/m3 (0.28 W/m2) and an internal resistance of 325 ohm for the c-MFCs (Figure S1B in File S1). After 45-day performance, the concentrations of unbounded bromine ions in c-MFCs and o-MFCs were 385.0±30.8 µg/L and 104.4±8.4 µg/L (Figure 1A), respectively. On day 70, significantly (p<0.01) different BDE-209 degradation rate were detected with around 58.9% in c-MFCs and 23.2% in o-MFCs. Obviously different PBDE congener profiles were observed between c-MFCs and o-MFCs. The concentrations of three nona-BDE congeners, BDE-208, -207, -206, were commonly found in both systems with a significant decrease in c-MFCs (Figure 1B), while the lower brominated PBDE congeners, BDE-153 and BDE-183 were only detected in o-MFCs. The concentrations of BDE-209 and the less brominated PBDE products were much lower in c-MFCs, suggesting that the PBDE removal could be markedly improved under microbial current generation condition.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.

Among a total of 9111 genes detected, 5646.5±9.2 were from c-MFC systems and only 638.3±56.9 were from o-MFC systems with 87.9% unique to c-MFC samples. For the shared genes, around 12.6% was significantly (p<0.01) increased and only 0.7% was significantly (p<0.01) decreased in c-MFC systems. The overall microbial functional diversity was significantly (p<0.02) higher in c-MFC based on the Shannon-Weiner (H’) index. The functional gene numbers and abundances of all functional gene categories were also significantly (p<0.01) increased in c-MFCs by computing the response ratio (RR). The total number and abundance of genes detected in c-MFCs were 9.7 and 8.5 times higher than those in o-MFCs, respectively (Table S1 in File S1).\nHierarchical clustering analysis showed that the c-MFC samples were clustered together and well separated from the o-MFC samples and six major gene groups could be visualized (Figure 2A). Within these six groups, 82.7% of detected genes belonged to Group 6, following with Group 4 (7.3%), Group 5 (5.0%), Group 2 (2.8%), Group 1 (1.5%) and Group 3 (0.7%) (Figure 2B). In Group 6, more than 92.3% genes detected were contributed by the c-MFC samples and the total gene abundance from c-MFCs was 28.9 times higher than that from o-MFCs with significant (p<0.01) increases in different gene categories as the following trend: energy process (15.7)<metal resistance (26.3) <phosphorus (27.1)<nitrogen cycling (27.3)<stress (28.6) = organic remediation (28.6)<carbon cycling (33.6)<sulphur (59.8). Within the 550 species detected in Group 6, 381 species were unique to the c-MFC samples.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 2.  Cluster analysis of functional genes detected using GeoChip 4.0.The figure was generated using CLUSTER and visualized in TREEVIEW. Black indicates signal intensities below the threshold value and red indicates a positive hybridization signal. The color intensity indicates differences in signal intensity. The samples from c-MFCs and o-MFCs on day 70 were clearly separated in two groups. Six different gene patterns were observed and indicated by numbers in the tree (A), and also illustrated in the graphs (B). (c1, c2, c3 represented the three replications of c-MFCs and o-1, o-2, o-3 represented those from o-MFCs.).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0070686.g002The abundances of most genes involved in carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S) cycling showed significant increases in c-MFCs. Among the C cycling genes detected, more than 86.2% involved in carbon degradation and almost all of these genes showed significantly (p<0.05) higher abundances in c-MFCs than in o-MFCs (Figure S2 in File S1). Totally, 745 N cycling genes were detected and belonged to 15 gene families involved in assimilatory N reduction, dissimilatory N reduction to ammonium, N2 fixation, denitrification processes, and ammonification (Figure S3 in File S1). Among those 15 gene families detected, 12 of them had significantly (p<0.05) higher abundances in c-MFCs than in o-MFCs. Higher number and abundance of the genes involved in S cycling were detected in c-MFCs (Figure S4 in File S1). For the detected 113 dsrA/B genes encoding dissimilatory sulfite reductase, 98 were unique to c-MFCs and four were unique to o-MFCs. For the genes involved in P cycling, 86 genes were detected and more than 82.1% of them were unique to c-MFC systems. The total abundance of ppk genes encoding polyphosphate kinase in c-MFCs was significant (p<0.05) higher than that in o-MFCs (Figure S5 in File S1). Details for these genes and their changes in c-MFC and o-MFC systems are described in the Data S2 in File S1.\nAll detected genes were derived from 574 genera with around 51.2% unique to c-MFCs and only 1.4% unique to o-MFCs. For the total signal intensities of the commonly detected genera, 11 were significantly increased at the p<0.01 level, and 72 were significantly increased at the p<0.05 level in c-MFCs. The total signal intensity of most well known versatile anodic respiring genera, Geobacter spp., Shewanella spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Desulfovibrio spp., were significantly enriched in c-MFCs at the p<0.01 or p<0.05 level, while no significant difference in the total signal intensity was observed for known dehalogenating microorganisms, such as Dehalococcoides spp. [25] and Desulfuromonas spp. [26].\n\n\nStimulations of the Functional Genes Involved in Aromatic Hydrocarbon Degradation and Chlorinated Solvent Remediation\nSome previous studies have shown that dioxygenases for catalyzing the oxidation of aromatic compounds were responsible for PBDE transformation [16], [17]. Consistently, GeoChip results showed that more than 75.5% of the organic remediation genes detected were involved in aromatic degradation and the aromatic degradation gene numbers detected in c-MFCs was around 10.5 times of those in o-MFCs. The abundances of relative genes for polycyclic aromatics, aromatic carboxylic acid, chlorinated aromatics, nitroaromatics and other aromatics showed significant (p<0.05) increases in c-MFCs (Figure 3A), and the genes for heterocyclic aromatics degradation were only detected in c-MFCs. Among the 45 aromatic degradation genes with significant changes in RR (Table S2 in File S1), only two of them, pimF from Bordetella petrii (163261940) for aromatic carboxylic acid degradation and nahA from Caulobacter sp. K31 (167645881) for polycyclic aromatics degradation, showed decreases under electricity generation conditions. The significant stimulation of the aromatic degradation genes suggests that these genes may be involved in PBDE transformation, and that the aromatic hydrocarbons transferred from BDE-209 could be further degraded under current generation condition.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 3.

All data are presented as mean±SE. *** p<0.001, **p<0.05, *p<0.10.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0070686.g003Furthermore, GeoChip detected 52 chlorinated solvent remediation genes from a variety of microorganisms with 48 unique to c-MFCs, 2 unique to o-MFCs and one shared by both. The reductive dehologenase gene (rd) from Dehalococcoides ethenogenes 195 (57233751) was shared by both. The two unique genes to o-MFCs were the pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent ethanol dehydrogenase gene (exaA) from Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus PAl 5 (162146364) and the reductive dehologenase gene (rd) from Dehalococcoides sp. VS (163811600). The 48 unique chlorinated solvent remediation genes detected in c-MFCs belonged to five gene families, including cmuA for methyltransferase, dehH for hydrolase, dehH109 for haloacid dehalogenase, exaA for pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent ethanol dehydrogenase and rd for reductive dehalogenase, and the highest gene abundance was observed for exaA (Figure 3B). The stimulation of these gene families indicated that not only reductive dehologenation genes/pathways, but also hydroxylation and methoxylation genes/pathways may be involved in the BDE-209 degradation.\n\n\nShifts of the Functional Genes Involved in Energy Process\nAmong the genes involved in energy process detected, the relative abundances of cytochrome genes and hydrogenase genes showed significant (p<0.05) increase in c-MFCs (Figure 4A). Among 106 genes involved in energy process, 91 genes were unique to the c-MFC samples and only three hydrogenase genes from Desulfovibrio vulgaris RCH1 (241879224, 241880985) and Anaeromyxobacter sp. K (197124673) were unique to o-MFCs. Seven P450 genes detected were all unique to c-MFC samples, and one with the highest signal intensity was from Burkholderia sp. 383 (78062539). Based on response ratio, cytochrome c class I genes from Geobacter sp. M21 (191162597) and Pseudomonas putida GB-1 (167034533) were significantly (p<0.05) increased in c-MFCs.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 4.  The normalized signal intensity of the detected key gens families (A) and the organisms (B) involved in energy transformation process under both c-MFCs and o-MFCs.The signal intensities were the sum of detected individual gene sequences for each functional gene, averaged among three samples. All data are presented as mean±SE. **p<0.05, *p<0.10.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0070686.g004All detected energy process genes belonged to 13 genera, among which seven genera were shared by both c-MFC and o-MFC samples, and six were unique to c-MFCs. Although no significant difference was observed from the known dehalogenating bacteria, Dehalococcoides spp., the three significant (p<0.05) enriched anodic respiring genera in c-MFCs (Figure 4B), Geobacter spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Shewanella spp., are all capable of aromatic degradation and dechlorination. These results suggest that the introduction of electrode may stimulate the versatile functional microbes for current generation and PBDE degradation.\n\n\nThe Composition of PBDE Congener as a Predominant Factor Shaping Microbial Community Functional Structure\nTo determine the correlations between the microbial community functional structure and the BDE-209 degradation, PCA was performed based on all detected functional genes, different functional gene categories and PBDE congeners, respectively. All of the samples from the c-MFCs and o-MFCs were well separated along PC1 when the functional genes detected were used as the species (Figure 5A). However, the opposite patterns were observed when the PBDE congeners were used as the variables (Figure 5B). These results suggested that the microbial functional gene compositions were significantly influenced by the microbial electricity generation and their abundances were increased with the degradation of PBDE congeners.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 5.

Consistent with PCA results, no matter the entire functional gene community or the gene categories for chlorinated solvent remediation or aromatic degradation were used as the species, the samples from c-MFCs and o-MFCs were well separated by the first axis which could explained more than 60% of the total variances. On the basis of variance in inflation factors, three variables were selected: electric voltage, the concentration of BDE-183 and BDE-206. The specified CCA model was significant (p = 0.018). Furthermore, these three factors could significantly (p = 0.032) explain the functional genes involved in chlorinated solvent remediation and aromatic degradation.\nTo separate the effects of electricity generation, PBDE congener composition and the hydrochemical parameters on microbial community structure after 70 days performance, a CCA-based variation partitioning analysis was conducted. The electric voltage, PBDE congener composition and hydrochemical parameters showed a significant (p = 0.041) correlation with the microbial functional gene structure. Electric voltage explained substantially more variation (49.41%, p = 0.001) than PBDE congener composition (27.02%, p = 0.028), whereas hydrochemical parameters independently explained 4.10% (p = 0.428) of the observed variation (Figure 6). About 19.40% of the functional community variation based on GeoChip data remained unexplained by the above selected variables. These results suggest that after 70 days performance the microbial electricity generation changed the microbial community structure and accelerated the PBDEs transformation, and the PBDE congeners conversely acted as the predominant factor for shaping the functional microbial community.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 6.

As the highly persistent hydrophobic organic pollutants, BDE-209 has been frequently detected in sediment and soil samples. It has been evidenced that BDE-209 could be slowly debrominated under anaerobic conditions by microorganisms. The amendments of trichloroethene as co-substrate [7], 4-bromobenzoic acid, 2,6-dibromobiphenyl, tetrabromobisphenol A or hexabromocyclododecane as primer compound [5] could significantly accelerate PBDE debromination. However, these strategies are unsuitable for bioremediation due to the toxicity of those added compounds. Our previous studies found that the amount of carbon source in sediment was enough to support PBDE debromination and the addition of exogenous electron donors could change the microbial community structure, as well as the PBDE congener compositions, but no significant decrease in total PBDE congeners was obtained [9], [18].More and more studies have demonstrated that the lack of suitable electron acceptors was the most limiting factor for biodegradation of organic pollutants in anaerobic sedimentary environments [27], [28]. The addition of electron acceptors has been applied as the promising strategies to stimulate the abundances and activities of the indigenous microorganisms for in situ anaerobic bioremediation of contaminated aquifers [29]. To date, chemical components, such as Fe(III), nitrate and sulfate, have been widely used to accelerate anaerobic biodegradation rate. However, all of these components are soluble, very easy to diffuse away from the point of application, and inappropriate for bioremediation of persistent organic pollutants, such as PBDEs, which require a long-term treatment. Electrodes, which could be permanently placed at a specific point of application, offer a low-maintenance source electron acceptor for promoting anaerobic biodegradation of organic contaminants [13], [14]. In this study, our results clearly showed that the functional microbial gene abundances and PBDE transformations could be significantly enhanced with simultaneous electricity generation, suggesting that the bioremediation of the persistent hydrophobic organic pollutants in anaerobic sedimentary conditions could be accelerated when microbial electricity was generated. It is interesting that the composition and amount of PBDE congeners generated from BDE-209 degradation were much less than our previous studies [9]. Since the same analyzing methods were used in those studies, it is reasonable to presume that compounds other than PBDE congeners were generated in this study which means new microbial BDE-209 degradation pathways might be involved. Some other enzymatic reactions such as hydroxylation or methoxylation of PBDEs have been observed in animals, birds, fishes and algae [30]. It is possible that similar reactions can be catalyzed by microorganisms, as suggested by the functional gene results in this study. Further researches are needed to confirm this hypothesis.To date, very few PBDE-degrading microbial strains were isolated. Given the structural similarity between PCBs and PBDEs, some known dechlorinators have been used to degrade the PBDEs, such as Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 [17], Sphingomonas sp. PH-07 [16] and Dehalococcoides sp. [7]. Although the involvements of some known dechlorinators in PBDE transformation were evidenced, very little information about the enzymes necessary to achieve PBDE biodegradation has been reported. Until now, only the typical dioxygenases required for PCB degradation have been identified to be involved in transformation of PBDEs by using reverse transcription quantitative PCR and gene recombinant analyses in a pure culture system [16], [17]. However, more and more evidence indicates that it is possible that an entirely different enzyme or multiple enzymes are responsible for PBDE transformation [17].GeoChip, as a comprehensive functional gene array, has been proven to be an ideal tool for analyzing microbial communities and linking their structure with environmental factors as well as ecosystem functioning [20], [21], [31], [32], [33]. In this study, GeoChip 4.0 was used to detect the functional microbial community composition and structure for PBDE transformation in c-MFC and o-MFC systems. Our results clearly showed that most important functional genes, including those involved in chlorinated solvent remediation, aromatic degradation and energy transformation process, were significantly stimulated and BDE-209 degradation was dramatically enhanced with simultaneous electricity generation. The significant positive correlations were generally observed between a range of functional gene categories and the removal rates of PBDEs, indicating that PBDE degradation process is complex and a variety of functional genes could be involved in PBDE transformation. Interestingly, for functional genes involved in chlorinated solvent remediation, not only those genes encoding reductive dehalogenase, but also those encoding methyltransferase and dehydrogenase were significantly increased in c-MFCs. These results suggest that reductive dehologenation, hydroxylation and methoxylation may be all involved in the degradation of BDE-209. The total signal intensities of most important microbes, which are capable of not only dechlorination but also anodic respiration, significantly increased in c-MFCs, suggesting that the introduction of electrode provided the condition for microbial electricity generation and enhance PBDE degradation. It will be necessary to combined some open format metagenome technologies to identify the new members and pathways involved in PBDE degradation during microbial electricity generation, since GeoChip can only detect the genes contained in the array.In summary, our results indicate that PBDE degradation could be stimulated with the significant increases of a variety of microbial functional genes after 70 days performance with electrode as the electron acceptor to produce microbial electricity. Our results also imply that PBDE biodegradation is a complex process in which reductive debromination, hydroxylation, and methoxylation, as well as aromatic degradation, may be all involved simultaneously. These findings strongly support the core hypothesis that the degradation of persistent organic pollutants in the anaerobic environments could be stimulated by the introduction of electrodes for microbial electricity generation. However, to elucidate the detailed PBDE biodegradation pathways under microbial electricity generation condition, it is essential to launch an integrated and comprehensive monitoring program to track the dynamics and adaptive responses of microbial communities to PBDE contamination together with other physical and chemical analysis in terms of microbial electricity generation, PBDE transformation and composition of their products."

                "\n        Intensive use of chlorpyrifos has resulted in its ubiquitous presence as a contaminant in surface streams and soils. It is thus critically essential to develop bioremediation methods to degrade and eliminate this pollutant from environments. We present here that a new fungal strain Hu-01 with high chlorpyrifos-degradation activity was isolated and identified as Cladosporium cladosporioides based on the morphology and 5.8S rDNA gene analysis. Strain Hu-01 utilized 50 mg·L−1 of chlorpyrifos as the sole carbon of source, and tolerated high concentration of chlorpyrifos up to 500 mg·L−1. The optimum degradation conditions were determined to be 26.8°C and pH 6.5 based on the response surface methodology (RSM). Under these conditions, strain Hu-01 completely metabolized the supplemented chlorpyrifos (50 mg·L−1) within 5 d. During the biodegradation process, transient accumulation of 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP) was observed. However, this intermediate product did not accumulate in the medium and disappeared quickly. No persistent accumulative metabolite was detected by gas chromatopraphy-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis at the end of experiment. Furthermore, degradation kinetics of chlorpyrifos and TCP followed the first-order model. Compared to the non-inoculated controls, the half-lives (t1/2) of chlorpyrifos and TCP significantly reduced by 688.0 and 986.9 h with the inoculum, respectively. The isolate harbors the metabolic pathway for the complete detoxification of chlorpyrifos and its hydrolysis product TCP, thus suggesting the fungus may be a promising candidate for bioremediation of chlorpyrifos-contaminated water, soil or crop.\n      "

            "fulltext": "IntroductionSynthetic organophosphates (OPs) are the most frequently and widely used insecticides, accounting for an estimated 34% of world-wide insecticide sales [1], [2]. Most organophosphorus insecticides share a similar structure, containing three phosphoester linkages and are hence often termed phosphotriesters [3]. This class of pesticides have acute neurotoxicity attributing to their ability to suppress acetylcholinesterase (AchE) [4], and various clinical effects can occur due to their poisoning in human beings [5]–[9].\nChlorpyrifos, [O,O-diethyl O-(3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyl) phosphorothioate] is one of the most extensively used broad-spectrum OPs, and its phosphorus is linked to a sulfur with a double bond (P = S) (Fig. 1). It is used throughout the world to control a variety of chewing and sucking insect pests and mites on a range of economically important crops, including citrus fruit, bananas, vegetables, potatoes, coffee, cocoa, tea, cotton, wheat, rice, and so on [10]. It is also registered for use on lawns, ornamental plants, animals, domestic dwellings as well as commercial establishments [11].\nA consequence of the persistent usage and broad-spectrum applicability of chlorpyrifos is widespread contamination in natural environment, leading to serious damage to non-target organisms [12]–[14]. Previous reports revealed that a wide range of water and terrestrial ecosystems have been contaminated with chlorpyrifos [15]–[17]. Moreover, much evidence suggests that chlorpyrifos may affect the endocrine system, respiratory system, cardiovascular system, nervous system, immune system, as well as the reproductive system due to its high mammalian toxicity [18]–[27]. Additionally, chlorpyrifos can be converted to 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP) in natural environment, a persistent metabolite that is refractory to microbial degradation [28], [29]. It has been suggested that the accumulated TCP in liquid medium or soil, which has antimicrobial property, prevents the proliferation of microorganisms involving in degrading chlorpyrifos [30]. TCP is classified as persistent and mobile by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with a half life ranging from 65 to 360 d in soil, depending on the soil type, climate, and other conditions [30]. As the major degradation product of chlorpyrifos, TCP has greater water solubility than its parent molecule and causes widespread contamination of soils and aquatic environments [4], [29], [30]. It is therefore essential to eliminate these pollutants from the environments.\nMicrobial detoxification of chlorpyrifos has become the focus of many studies because other methods of removing chlorpyrifos residues are impractical or costly or are themselves environmentally hazardous [5]. To date, several chlorpyrifos-degrading bacterial strains including Enterobacter strain B-14 [31], Stenotrophomonas sp. strain YC-1 [32], Sphingomonas sp. strain Dsp-2 [33], Paracoccus sp. strain TRP [29], Bacillus pumilus strain C2A1 [4], and Bacillus laterosporus strain DSP [34] have been isolated from diverse sources; however, only Paracoccus sp. strain TRP and Bacillus pumilus strain C2A1 were able to degrade both chlorpyrifos and TCP. One recently isolated cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. strain PUPCCC 64, was also capable of degrading chlorpyrifos [35]. However, there is limited information concerning the ability of fungus to degrade chlorpyrifos, e.g. only Verticillium sp. strain DSP [36], [37] and Acremonium sp. strain GFRC-1 [38]. Fungi are critical to the biogeochemical cycle and are responsible for the bulk of the degradation of environmental xenobiotics in the biosphere [39]. Moreover, the ability of fungi to form extended mycelial networks, the low specificity of their catabolic enzymes and their independence from utilizing organic chemicals as a growth substrate make fungi well suited for bioremediation processes [40]. However, the potential use of fungus in bioremediation of OPs has not received the attention it deserves. This is the first report to our knowledge involving in the biodegradation of both chlorpyrifos and its hydrolysis product TCP by fungus.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.  Molecular structure of chlorpyrifos.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0047205.g001In the current study, a new fungus Cladosporium cladosporioides strain Hu-01 able to degrade not only chlorpyrifos but also TCP was isolated and characterized. Moreover, the optimal culture conditions were investigated and the degradation pathway was elucidated.\nMaterials and Methods\nChemicals and Media\nChlorpyrifos standard (97% purity) was obtained from Dow AgroSciences, USA. TCP standard (99% purity) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA. Chromatographic-grade methanol was purchased from Burdic & Jackson, USA. All other chemicals and reagents used were of pure analytical-grade and available commercially. Stock solutions (10 g·L−1) were prepared with methanol, sterilized by membrane filtration (0.45 µm), and stored in dark bottles at 20°C before use.\nCzapek-Dox medium (CDM) containing (in gram per litre) sucrose, 30; NaNO3, 2; KCl, 0.5; MgSO4, 0.5; K2HPO4, 1; Fe2(SO4)3, 0.01; and peptone, 0.5; and mineral salt medium (MSM) containing (in gram per litre) (NH4)2SO4, 2; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.2; CaCl2·2H2O, 0.01; FeSO4·7H2O, 0.001, Na2HPO4·12H2O, 1.5; and KH2PO4, 1.5 were used for the isolation of fungal strains.\n\n\nEnrichment and Isolation of the Chlorpyrifos-degrading Fungi\nActivated sludge samples were collected as the inoculum from an aerobic chlorpyrifos-manufacturing wastewater treatment system located in Jiangmen, China, which had produced chlorpyrifos for over 15 years. Enrichment and isolation of degrading strains were carried out in MSM by using an enrichment culture technique as described in detail previously [41]–[43]. Colonies with different morphologies grown on the plates were picked and purified using the streaking method. The isolates were tested for their capacities to degrade chlorpyrifos and TCP. One pure isolate showing the highest degradation was selected for further study and designated Hu-01.\n\n\nIdentification and Characterization of Strain Hu-01\nThe isolate was grown on CDM agar plates for 5 d and its morphology was investigated by light microscope (BH-2 Olympus, Japan) and scanning electron microscope (XL-30 ESEM, Philips Optoelectronics Co., Ltd, Holland). Colony morphology was observed on CDM agar plates incubated at 27°C at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 d. Total genomic DNA was prepared according to the method of Sambrook and Russell [44]. The 5.8S rDNA gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the universal primers ITS 5 (5′-GGAAGTAAAAGTC GTAACAAGG-3′) and ITS 4 (5′-GCATATCAATAAGCGGAGGA-3′) [45]. Reaction conditions consisted of initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 1 min, with the last cycle followed by a ten-minute extension at 72°C. After purification by agarose gel electrophoresis, PCR fragments were ligated to the linearized vector pMD20-T (TaKaRa Biotechnology Co. Ltd., China), and transformed into competent Escherichia coli DH5α cells. Sequencing of the cloned insert was performed by Shanghai Invitrogen Technology Co. Ltd., China. The resulting sequence was compared with the genes available in the GenBank nucleotide library by a BLAST search through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) internet site. Multiple alignments of 5.8S rDNA were performed by ClustalX 1.8.1 with default settings, and phylogenesis was analyzed using MEGA 4.0 software. An unrooted tree was built using the neighbor-joining method [46].\n\n\nInoculum Preparation\nInoculum was prepared by growing the isolate in 50 mL of CDM for 3 d at 27°C with shaking at 150 rpm. Mycelia were harvested by centrifugation at 4600 × g for 5 min, washed with 0.9% sterile saline and resuspended in 50 mL saline. Two percent of this suspension was used as inoculum for chlorpyrifos and TCP biodegradation studies [47].\n\n\nOptimization of the Culture Conditions for Chlorpyrifos Degradation by Strain Hu-01\nThe culture conditions favoring chlorpyrifos degradation by strain Hu-01 was determined by using response surface methodology (RSM) [48]. The significant factors that were selected as independent variables were pH, temperature, and culture time based on the results of preliminary one-factor-at-a-time experiments. A five-level (−1.68, −1, 0, 1, 1.68) central composite rotatable design (CCRD) consisting of 23 experimental runs with three replicates at the center point was generated by statistic analysis system (SAS) software package (Version 9.0, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Regression analysis was performed on the data obtained from the design experiments. Coding of the variables was carried out according to the following equation (Eq.(1))(1)where xi is the dimensionless value of an independent variable, Xi is the real value of an independent variable, X0 is the real value of an independent variable at the center point, and ΔXi is the step change of real value of the variable i corresponding to a variation of a unit for the dimensionless value of the variable i. The symbols and levels of the three independent variables are presented in Table 1. The dependent variable was the degradation of 50 mg·L−1 chlorpyrifos by strain Hu-01 by hour 12. Randomised block design was conducted in order to minimise the effects of unexplained variability in the observed response because of extraneous factors [49]. The data were analyzed by using the response surface regression procedure of the SAS software to fit the following quadratic polynomial equation (Eq.(2))(2)where Yi is the predicted response, Xi and Xj are variables, b0 is the constant, bi is the linear coefficient, bij is the interaction coefficient, and bii is the quadratic coefficient, respectively.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 1.  The symbols and levels of three independent variables used in central composite rotatable design (CCRD).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0047205.t001The coefficient of determination (R2) and adjusted R2 (Adj.R2) were used for the verification of the significance of the quadratic polynomial model. The significant variables were screened based on the F-test and the P-value at the 95% significance level [50]. On the basis of the analysis of variance (ANOVA), parameters with a significance level (P) greater than 5% were removed to obtain the final reduced model. The final model can be displayed as three-dimensional (3D) response surface plots by varying two factor levels while keeping the other factor at a constant level [51]. The SAS software package was applied for the regression analysis and the graphical presentation.\n\n\nIdentification of Metabolic Products during Chlorpyrifos Degradation\nThe degradation products of chlorpyrifos in mycelium-free filtrates of the fungal cultures grown in MSM containing 50 mg·L−1 of chlorpyrifos were determined by gas chromatopraphy-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (Agilent 6890N/5975, USA). The mycelium-free filtrates were collected at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 d, respectively. Non-inoculated media served as controls. The metabolic products confirmed on the basis of mass spectrum were matched with authentic standard compounds from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, USA) library database.\n\n\nDegradation Kinetics of Chlorpyrifos and TCP by Strain Hu-01\nThe abilities of strain Hu-01 to degrade chlorpyrifos and its hydrolysis product TCP were investigated in MSM under the optimal culture conditions. Chlorpyrifos and TCP were added to 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks to give the final concentration of 50 mg·L−1, respectively. The flasks were incubated at 27°C on a platform shaker at 150 rpm for 7 d. The experiment was conducted in triplicate with non-inoculated samples as control. The samples were collected periodically and the chemical residues were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Agilent 1100, USA).\n\n\nChemical Analysis\nA modified method from Gao et al. [52] was used to determine the residues of chlorpyrifos and TCP. In brief, samples (30 mL) were extracted using the mixture of acetone and dichloromethane in an equal volume ratio (1:1, v/v). After concentration by using rotary evaporator (Heidolph, Germany), residues dissolved in methanol were determined by HPLC equipped with a Hypersil ODS2 C18 reversed phase column (4.6 nm × 250 mm, 5 µm) with array detection from 190–400 nm (total scan). A mixture of methanol and water (70:30, v/v) was used as the mobile phase after acidification to pH 3 with concentrated phosphoric acid. The injection volume was 10 µL.\nThe degradation products of chlorpyrifos were identified according to the method of Xu et al. [29] with modification. In brief, the mycelium-free cultures were extracted with petroleum ether and the supernatant was dehydrated, dried and re-dissolved in methanol. After filtration with 0.45 µm membrance (Millipore, USA), the samples were detected by GC-MS system equipped with auto-sampler, an on-column, split/splitless capillary injection system, and with HP-5MS capillary column (30.0 m × 250 µm × 0.25 µm) with array detection from 30–500 nm (total scan). The operating conditions were as follows: the column was held at 80°C for 5 min, ramped at 8°C·min−1 to 200°C (first ramp), held at 200°C for 5 min, ramped at 15°C·min−1 to 260°C (second ramp), and then held at at 260°C for 5 min. The temperatures corresponding to transfer line and the ion trap were 280°C and 230°C, respectively, and the ionization energy was 70 eV. The injection volume was 1.0 µL with a split ratio of 1:7 at 260°C. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL·min−1.\n\n\nData Analysis\nResults were assessed by ANOVA and statistical analyses were performed on three replicates of data obtained from each treatment. The significance (P<0.05) of differences was treated statistically by one-, two-, or three-way ANOVA and evaluated by Tukey’s test.\n\n\nEthics Statement\nNo specific permits were required for the described field studies. No specific permissions were required for these locations. We confirm that the location is not privately-owned or protected in any way. We confirm that the field studies did not involve endangered or protected species.\n\nResults\nIsolation and Identification of the Fungal Strain Hu-01\nAfter five rounds of transfer, a total of 8 pure isolates able to grow with chlorpyrifos as the sole carbon source were obtained from the enrichment culture (Table S1). One fungal strain, designated Hu-01, was selected for further study due to its highest degradation activity on both chlorpyrifos and TCP. This fungus degraded and tolerated chlorpyrifos and TCP with concentrations as high as 500 mg·L−1, and completely metabolized the added chlorpyrifos and TCP (both 50 mg·L−1) within 5 and 6 d, respectively.\nStrain Hu-01 was an obligately aerobic fungus with strong spore production. Colonies were dark green, round, and with concentric rings and entire margin when grown on CDM agar plates. Spores were oval, umbilicate, and with dimensions of 4.0 to 6.0 µm in length and 2.0 to 3.0 µm in width (Figure S1). Mycelia were dark olivaceous which differed from most genus of fungi. A single fragment of 574 bp was obtained after the PCR amplification. The DNA G+C content is 50.9 mol %. Phylogenetic analysis of the 5.8S rDNA gene sequences revealed that strain Hu-01 grouped among Cladosporium species and was closely related to C. cladosporioides strain ATT097 (GenBank accession No. H607834) and C. cladosporioides strain CY141 (GenBank accession No. HQ607983) with high identities (>99%) (Fig. 2). Thus, strain Hu-01 was tentatively identified as C. cladosporioides based on the morphology and 5.8S rDNA gene analysis. The partial 5.8S rDNA gene sequences have been deposited at the GenBank under the accession No. EF405864. The C. cladosporioides strain Hu-01 was also deposited in China Center for Type Culture Collection under the collection No. CCTCC M 20711.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 2.

The design matrix of the variables together with the experimental responses is given in Table 2. Subsequently, the data from Table 2 were assessed by response surface regression procedure of SAS software package, and the results of the quadratic polynomial model fitting in the term of analysis of variance (ANOVA) were shown in Table 3. By applying the multiple regression analysis on the experimental data, the following quadratic polynomial equation (Eq.(3)) was derived to explain the chlorpyrifos degradation:(3)where Y is the predicted chlorpyrifos degradation (%) by strain Hu-01; X1, X2, and X3 are the coded values for the pH, temperature, and culture time, respectively.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 2.

The statistical analysis indicated that the model linear term coefficient of X2 and X3 and the quadric term coefficient of X1, X2 and X3 showed significant effects (P<0.05) on chlorpyrifos degradation.

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the fitted quadratic polynomial model for chlorpyrifos degradation.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0047205.t003The adequacy of the model was examined by the determination coefficient (R2 = 0.9650), which explained 96.50% of the response variability, suggesting that the predicted values of the model were well correlated with the experimental values (Table 4). The high value of the adjusted R2 (0.9408) further supported the accuracy of the model. These results suggested that the response equation provided a suitable and reasonable model for the CCRD experiment. Besides, the low coefficient of variation (CV = 5.8%) demonstrated a good precision and reliability of the experiments. The developed model thus could be adequate for prediction within the range of variables employed.\nA three-dimensional (3D) response surface was plotted to directly display the effects of temperature and culture time on the chlorpyrifos degradation by strain Hu-01 while keeping the value of pH (the non-significant variable) at a zero level (Fig. 3). The model predicted a maximum chlorpyrifos degradation of 85.9% at the stationary point. At the stationary point, the optimum levels for the three variables of X1, X2 and X3 were observed to be −0.1460, −0.2627 and 0.6851 in terms of the coded units, that is, pH 6.5, temperature 26.8°C, and culture time 4.7 d, respectively. So the optimum culture conditions for chlorpyrifos degradation by strain Hu-01 were determined to be pH 6.5, 26.8°C, and 4.7 d.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 4.

The GC-MS results showed that two peaks at retention times (RT) of 15.135 and 9.140 min representing metabolites A and B, respectively.\nEach of the two peaks was identified on the basis of its mass spectra and the NIST library identification program. The peak at retention time of 15.135 min corresponded to chlorpyrifos standard. This peak disappeared concomitantly with formation of another new peak with a retention time of around 9.140 min. Based on the characteristic fragment ion peaks and molecular ion (m/z), the new peak was identified as TCP (Fig. 4). However, this new peak was transient and it disappeared finally. Eventually, no persistent accumulative metabolite was detectable by GC-MS after 6 d of incubation.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 4.

That is to say, the parent chlorpyrifos (m/z = 351) was first metabolized by hydrolysis to produce TCP (m/z = 197) and diethylthiophosphoric acid (DETP) (m/z = 172). Subsequently, the hydrolysis product TCP was further transformed by ring breakage, resulting in its complete detoxification. These results thus indicated that the added chlorpyrifos (50 mg·L−1) was completely degraded by strain Hu-01 without any accumulative products after 6 d of incubation.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 5.

Introduction with strain Hu-01, rapid degradation was observed at the beginning of incubation, apparently there was no lag period and 89.0% of the 50 mg·L−1 chlorpyrifos initially added to the medium was degraded within 1 d. After 5 d of incubation complete degradation was achieved by the fungus; whereas the non-inoculated control this value decreased only by 14.4%. In the case of TCP, similar accelerated degradation was observed and 93.5% of the added TCP (50 mg·L−1) was eliminated within 1 d. After 6 d of incubation, there is no TCP detectable in the medium. In contrast, more than 88% of the added TCP remained in the medium that was not inoculated after completion of the experiment. During the chlorpyrifos degradation, trace amounts of TCP was also detected in the medium inoculated with strain Hu-01, but no TCP was found at the end of experiment. Therefore, incubation with strain Hu-01 resulted in greater chlorpyrifos and TCP degradation as compared to that in the non-inoculated controls.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 6.

Error bars represent the standard deviation of three replicates.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0047205.g006To confirm the effects on biodegradation of chlorpyrifos and TCP by strain Hu-01, the first-order kinetic model (Eq.(5)) adapted from Cycoń et al. [3] was used to determine the rate of total chemical reduction(5)where C0 is the initial concentration of chemical at time zero, Ct is the concentration of chemical at time t, k and t are the degradation rate constant (h−1) and degradation period in hours, respectively.\nThe algorithm as expressed in Eq.(6) was used to describe the theoretical half-life (t1/2) values of chlorpyrifos and TCPwhere ln2 is the logarithmic function, k is the rate constant (h−1).\nThe kinetic parameters for all runs calculated from the above equations (Eq.(5) and Eq.(6)) are presented in Table 5. In these studies, the degradation rate and the chemical concentration were in direct proportion, and the degradation process corresponded to the first-order kinetics with a R2 ranging from 0.9165 to 0.9904, revealing that the experimental data fit well with the model. The k for chlorpyrifos and TCP with strain Hu-01 were 0.1398 and 0.2201 h−1, respectively; while the control the k were 0.0010 and 0.0007 h−1, respectively. The t1/2 for chlorpyrifos and TCP with strain Hu-01 were 5.0 and 3.1 h, respectively. In contrast, the t1/2 for chlorpyrifos and TCP in the non-inoculated controls were 693.0 and 990.0 h, respectively. Compared with the controls, the t1/2 for chlorpyrifos and TCP greatly reduced by 688.0 and 986.9 h, respectively. These results thus confirmed that inoculation with strain Hu-01 significantly enhanced degradation of chlorpyrifos and TCP. At the end of the reaction, both pollutants were successfully eliminated by the fungal strain C. cladosporioides Hu-01.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 5.  Kinetic parameters of degradation of chlorpyrifos and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP) by strain Hu-01.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0047205.t005\nGiven the widespread chlorpyrifos use around the world and prevalent human exposure, effective techniques for disposal of this pollutant are critically needed [6], [9], [53], [54]. Bioremediation provides a cheap and environmentally friendly way to remove toxic pollutants from the environment [2]. In the current study, a novel fungal strain C. cladosporioides strain Hu-01 responsible for chlorpyrifos degradation was isolated from organophosphate-contaminated soils using an enrichment procedure. This particular isolate completely degraded not only chlorpyrifos but also its hydrolysis product TCP. This feature is rarely reported in other chlorpyrifos-degrading microorganisms. In most cases reported to date, the individual isolate tended to transform chlorpyrifos by hydrolysis of ester linkage to yield TCP, which in turn accumulated in the batch cultures or soils and enhanced degradation could not occur owing to its antimicrobial properties [4], [28], [29], [30], [32]. TCP is associated with estrogenic activity and has recently been listed as potential endocrine disrupting chemical by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the USA [55]. Compared with the importance of TCP degradation issue, studies concerning its fate and degradation in the environment are very limited. Ralstonia sp. strain T6 was reported to metabolize 100 mg·L−1 TCP within 12 h, but it could not transform chlorpyrifos [30]. As far as we know, this is the first report about a fungal strain involving in chlorpyrifos and TCP degradation.There has been some success in the use of degrading bacteria for bioremediation of chlorpyrifos. For example, Dubey and Fulekar [56] demonstrated that Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strain MHF ENV20 isolated from rhizosphere played an important role in reducing chlorpyrifos level in soil. Plasmid-mediated bioaugmentation for the enhanced biodegradation of chlorpyrifos in soil was recently achieved by the indigenous bacteria, including members of the Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus genera [34]. Unfortunately, relative contributions of fungi to degradation processes have seldom been quantified. Fungi possess the biochemical and ecological capacity to detoxify environmental xenobiotics, either by chemical modification or by influencing chemical bioavailability [36]. However, despite dominating the living biomass in soil and being abundant in aqueous systems, fungi have not received the attention they deserve. Though several fungal strains have been reported to degrade chlorpyrifos, yet attempts to isolate fungi in pure culture able to mineralize chlorpyrifos have often failed [36]–[38], [57]. For example, mineralization of chlorpyrifos (50 mg·L−1) was achieved by co-culture of Serratia sp. TCR and Trichosporon sp. TCF, but the pure fungal strain TCF alone could not transform chlorpyrifos [57].In order to obtain efficient degradative fungi, in the last few years our laboratory has screened a wide range of contaminated soils from organophosphate-manufactuer system in China for chlorpyrifos degradation activity. A fungal strain, designated Hu-01, capable of completely degrading chlorpyrifos and its hydrolysis product TCP was successfully isolated from the soil. 5.8S rDNA gene sequencing and the morphological characteristics strongly revealed that strain Hu-01 belongs to the genus Cladosporium. To the best of our knowledge, there is no information regarding the ability to metabolize organophosphorous pesticides by fungal strain belonging to the genus Cladosporium. Nevertheless, several studies have suggested that Cladosporium species have some potential bioactivity, such as antimicrobial activity and the ability to degrade aromatic compounds [47], [58], [59].Notably, C. cladosporioides strain Hu-01 was found to efficiently degrade chlorpyrifos over a broad range of temperature and pH particularly at low pH, as summarized in Table 2. This feature gives pesticide degraders advantages in the variable environments, because they survival and utilize xenobiotic compounds even exposed to adverse conditions. In contrast, previous studies showed that rapid degradation of chlorpyrifos by Enterobactor sp. was observed at high pH while this activity was very slow at acidic pH [60]. Anwar et al. [4] reported that chlorpyrifos was more efficiently degraded at basic as well as neutral pH whereby more than 80% of the added pesticide was degraded by Bacillus pumilus strain C2A1 and no lag phase was observed at relatively higher pH. However, at acidic pH only 50% degradation was observed with longer lag phase. Our results contrasted with previous findings and the chlorpyrifos degradation by strain Hu-01 was higher at the acidic conditions. It is possible that some key enzyme(s) responsible for chlorpyrifos degradation have their optimum enzymatic activity at relatively low pH value. Another important feature which is worth mentioning is that this strain engaged in efficient degradation of chlorpyrifos and its hydrolysis product TCP up to the concentrations, as high as 500 mg·L−1. In contrast to other reports on toxic effects of chlorpyrifos on diverse microorganisms [28], [29], [61], our results indicated that chlorpyrifos metabolism activity of strain Hu-01 was not subject to complete catabolite repression by high chlorpyrifos concentrations. High chlorpyrifos tolerance and degradation capability of C. cladosporioides strain Hu-01, makes this strain suitable for decontamination and remediation of contaminated sites.In this study, the optimum culture conditions for chlorpyrifos degradation by C. cladosporioides strain Hu-01 were determined by using response surface methodology (RSM). RSM is an empirical modeling system that has been successfully applied to improve and optimize complex processes, including fermentation processes and medium components for a variety of microorganisms [50], [51]. Previous studies have shown that the application of statistical experimental design techniques in biodegradation processes can result in improved yields of degradation and allow the rapid and economical determination of the optimum culture conditions with fewer experiments and minimal resources [47], [49], [62]–[65]. In the present study, RSM is first employed to optimize culture conditions favouring chlorpyrifos degradation. The optimization parameters investigated include pH, temperature and culture time. The results of the experiments were statistically analyzed and the significance and effect of each factor on responses was evaluated. The optimum degradation conditions were determined to be pH 6.5, 26.8°C, and culture time 4.7 d. Under these conditions, strain Hu-01 reached a maximum chlorpyrifos degradation of approximately 85% within 12 h. Moreover, a mathematical model (Eq.(4)) was developed herein, and this model could be effectively used to predict and optimize the chlorpyrifos degradation conditions by strain Hu-01 within the limits of chosen factors.It was generally considered that ester hydrolysis was the primary degradation pathway of chlorpyrifos [66], [67]. In most cases, the degrading microorganisms tend to metabolize chlorpyrifos by hydrolysis to form diethylthiophosphoric acid (DETP) and TCP [4], [29], [31], [32]. However, due to its resistant to enhanced degradation, studies on further metabolism and identification of intermediate products of chlorpyrifos have not been extensive [29]. In our studies, degradation of chlorpyrifos was accompanied by a transient accumulation of TCP. Moreover, the only intermediate product disappeared quickly. Obviously, TCP was further transformed without any other persistent metabolites by strain Hu-01. Finally, no persistent accumulative metabolite was detected by GC-MS after 6 d of incubation. Some other metabolites might have formed and been immediately degraded by the fungus. In our previous work, we have purified the chlorpyrifos hydrolase from the fungus [52]. Based on these results, the metabolic pathway of chlorpyrifos was first proposed (Fig. 5).Previous studies suggested that the conditions for environmental microorganism enrichment and screening are of vital importance in the selection of pure isolates with high survivability in the environment and maximum degrading activity towards xenobiotics [29]. However, it has been problematic to isolate a pure isolate capable of utilizing chlorpyrifos and TCP for growth substrates [4]. Several reported microorganisms degraded chlorpyrifos and TCP co-metabolically, which needed extra carbon sources for enhanced degradation [68], [69]. In our studies, the fungal strain isolated from the contaminated soils appeared to be highly efficient in degrading chlorpyrifos and TCP in MSM without any other carbon sources and utilizing these pollutants as the sole carbon sources. It could utilize 89.0% and 93.5% of the added chlorpyrifos and TCP (both 50 mg·L−1) within 1 d, respectively (Fig. 6). The t1/2 for chlorpyrifos and TCP greatly reduced by 688.0 and 986.9 h, respectively as compared to the controls (Table 5). These results demonstrated the isolate may be suitable for the efficient and rapid bioremediation of contaminated environments.In conclusion, the C. cladosporioides strain Hu-01 isolated in the present study completely metabolized not only chlorpyrifos but also its hydrolysis product TCP. This is the first report involving in the biodegradation of both chlorpyrifos and TCP by a fungal strain from the genus Cladosporium. Moreover, metabolization of chlorpyrifos and TCP by the same strain is of vital importance because TCP possesses antimicrobial activities, and it tends to accumulate in the batch cultures or soils and hence prevents the proliferation of microorganisms responsible for the parent compound degradation through catabolite repression. In addition, strain Hu-01 was found highly efficient in degrading chlorpyrifos over a wide range of temperature and pH particularly at low pH. This feature gives pesticide degraders advantages in the variable environments. Another important feature which is worth mentioning is that this strain harbors the metabolic pathway for the detoxification of chlorpyrifos, and it completely degraded chlorpyrifos without any persistent accumulative metabolites. Furthermore, the fungus utilized chlorpyrifos and TCP as the sole carbon sources for growth, thus suggesting adaptation to oligotrophic environments. The ability to survive at high concentration of chlorpyrifos and enhanced degradation make this isolate an ideal candidate for its application in chlorpyrifos bioremediation."

                "Background: Incorporation of exogenous glucanase into animal feed is common practice to remove glucan, one of the anti-nutritional factors, for efficient nutrition absorption. The acidic endo-β-1,3-1,4-glucanase (Bgl7A) from Bispora sp. MEY-1 has excellent properties and represents a potential enzyme supplement to animal feed. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we successfully developed a transgenic maize producing a high level of Bgl7AM (codon modified Bgl7A) by constructing a recombinant vector driven by the embryo-specific promoter ZM-leg1A. Southern and Western blot analysis indicated the stable integration and specific expression of the transgene in maize seeds over four generations. The β-glucanase activity of the transgenic maize seeds reached up to 779,800 U/kg, about 236-fold higher than that of non-transgenic maize. The β-glucanase derived from the transgenic maize seeds had an optimal pH of 4.0 and was stable at pH 1.0–8.0, which is in agreement with the normal environment of digestive tract. Conclusion/Significance: Our study offers a transgenic maize line that could be directly used in animal feed without any glucanase production, purification and supplementation, consequently simplifying the feed enzyme processing procedure.

            "fulltext": "Introductionβ-1,3-1,4-d-Glucans (β-glucans) are the main component of cereal cell walls, particularly in the endosperm cell walls of barley and other grains [1]. It is composed of β-d-glycosyl residues linked through irregular β-1,3 and/or β-1,4 glycosidic bonds. Ruminants can utilize β-glucans through enzyme digestion of rumen microbes. However, monogastric animals such as pig, poultry, and fish do not have such enzymes to decompose the β-glucans. By combining with water, β-glucans increase the viscosity of chyme, block the intestinal surface partially, and prevent the mixing of intestinal endogenous digestive juice with the chyme [2]. Thus β-glucan represents one of the intense anti-nutritional factors in wheat- and barley-based diets [3].\nTo overcome these problems, the most common and effective practice is to add exogenous endoglucanases into animal feed [3]. Majority of endoglucanases are grouped into glycoside hydrolase (GH) families 3, 5, 7, 12 and 16, based on the amino acid sequence and catalytic domain structures (http://www.cazy.org/). According to the degradation mode against glycosidic linkage, endoglucanases have been grouped into four main categories: β-1,3-glucanase (laminarinase, EC 3.2.1.39), β-1,4-glucanases (cellulase, EC 3.2.1.4), β-1,3-1,4-glucanases (lichenase, EC 3.2.1.73), and β-1,3(4)-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.6) [4]. Among them, β-1,3-1,4-glucanase has received significant attention in feed industrial applications because of their hydrolysis ability against grain-based glucan and multiple enzymatic functions. β-1,3-1,4-Glucanase is able to catalyze the hydrolysis of β-glucan into low molecular weight glucose polymers, thus reducing the hydrophilicity and viscosity of chyme and eliminating the anti-nutritional negative effect. Moreover, addition of β-1,3-1,4-glucanase can improve feed intake, enhance animal production, regulate cecal microbiota and increase feed conversion ratio [5]–[8]. Besides, the hydrolysis products from glucans—glucooligosaccharides may serve as fermentable dietary fiber-like substrates and positively affect gastrointestinal tract health [9].\nTo date, commercial feed additive β-1,3-1,4-glucanases are generally from microbial expression systems, commonly Aspergillus japonicus [10], Pichia pastoris [11] and Clostridium thermocellum [8]. This process is flexible and convenient, but has disadvantages like high energy consumption, high equipment cost and serious environmental pollution. Moreover, enzyme addition is a complex process involving enzyme isolation, purification and supplementation, which requires more energy and resources. Thus it's a good way to produce feed enzymes (e.g. β-1,3-1,4-glucanase) in transgenic feed grains directly without any industrial processing.\nTransgenic plants are being developed for both commercial and environmental values. In 2011, the plantation area of transgenic plants reached about 160 million hectares worldwide and was distributed in 29 countries; transgenic maize accounted for nearly one third of the total genetically modified crops [12]. Maize (Zea mays L.) is the main ingredient of animal feed (nearly 50%), and represents an ideal bioreactor of feed enzymes because of its cultivation worldwide. A phytase gene phyA2 from Aspergillus niger has been successfully overexpressed in maize seeds [13].\nIn this study, we developed a genetically stable maize line that had high β-glucanase activity in the seeds. The endo-β-1,3-1,4-glucanase, Bgl7A, from acidophilic Bispora sp. MEY-1 was selected due to its excellent properties as feed additive, such as acidic pH optimum, good thermostability and broad pH stability, highly resistance to proteases, and broad substrate specificity [11]. The gene codon was optimized for better expression in maize.\nMaterials and Methods\nPlant materials\nMaize Hi-II [14] was used for genetic transformation as host variety. The immature embryos, approximately 1.0–2.0 mm long, were preserved on N61-100-25 medium [14] containing 0.2% (w/v) phytagel (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for callus induction. The commercial maize inbred-line Zheng58 was used as recurrent parent to produce progenies.\n\n\nCodon optimization of the β-1,3-1,4-glucanase gene bgl7A\nTo improve its expression level in transgenic maize, the DNA sequence of native endo-β-1,3-1,4-glucanase gene bgl7A from Bispora sp. MEY-1 (Genbank accession No. FJ695140) [11] was optimized according to the translationally optimal codon usage of maize [15]. Codon adaptation index (CAI), optimal codon usage, GC content and distribution, effective number of codons (Nc), negative CIS elements, negative repeat elements, and mRNA structure were used to evaluate the gene sequence (https://www.genscript.com/cgi-bin/tools/​rare_codon_analysis). Low-usage codons (<15% frequency) were replaced by high-usage ones according to the known codon bias of maize [15]. The modified gene was named bgl7Am that encoded the same amino acid sequence as bgl7A. The optimized gene was synthesized by Genscript (Nanjing, China) and cloned into pUC57 vector to construct the recombinant plasmid pUC57-bgl7Am.\n\n\nPlasmid construction\nThe transformation vector pHP20754 (Fig. 1a) consists of the corn legumin1A (leg1) promoter ZM-leg1A Pro, signal peptide (SP), vacuole targeting sequence (VTS) of corn Proaleurain and the corn leg1 terminator ZM-leg1 Term [16]–[18]. The β-glucanase gene was excised from pUC57-bgl7Am with BamHI and XmaI and subcloned into pHP20754 to produce the expression construct pHP20754-bgl7Am, which was further digested with PvuII to generate the chimeric gene expression cassette (Fig. 1b) for transformation. The plasmid pHP17042BAR carrying the maize histone H2B promoter, the maize Ubiquitin 5′-UTR intron-1, the bar gene and the potato protease II (PINII) terminator [13] was used as the selectable marker for screening of positive transgenic plants. The bar gene expression cassette was excised from pHP17042BAR by digest with HindIII, XhoI and SacI.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.

C Ears and seeds of transgenic maize (T1 and BC3) compared with that of wild-type Zheng58.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0081993.g001\n\nMaize transformation, selection and regeneration\nThe plasmid fragments containing the gene cassette of bgl7Am and bar, respectively, were mixed at the ratio of 1:1 and adjusted the concentration to 200 ng/µL. Maize transformation was carried out with high-velocity tungsten microprojectile (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) wrapped by the DNAs of bgl7Am and bar according to the method described before [19]. After recovery, embryonic calli were transferred onto the selective medium supplemented with bialaphos as the selectable marker. The positively transformed calli were cultivated in differentiation medium and rooting medium in succession. Seedlings (T0 plants) were transplanted into greenhouse and pollinated with the inbred-line Zheng58 to produce T1 seeds. Seeds were dried on the plant and harvested 35–45 days after pollination. Zheng58 was used as recurrent parent for backcrossing to produce filial generations (T1, BC1, BC2 and BC3). β-Glucanase activity determination in the kernels and PCR for the bgl7Am gene of seedlings were used in combination to screen the transgenic lines.\n\n\nPCR detection of exogenous gene integration\nThe specific primers bgl7am-875F (5′-ACGGCAAGGTCATCCAGAACGCGAAGG-3′) and 20754-398R (5′-TTCCTGGCAAATCACTCGGTGTATC-3′) were used for PCR detection of the positive plants harboring bgl7Am. The gene actin as control was amplified using primers AC326F (5′-ATGTTTCCTGGGATTGCCGAT-3′) and AC326R (5′-GCATCACAAGCCAGTTTAACC-3′). Genomic DNA of the maize immature leaves was used as PCR templates. The recombinant plasmid pHP20754-bgl7Am and the genomic DNA of Zheng58 were used as the positive and negative controls, respectively.\n\n\nSouthern blot analysis\nFive grams of maize leaves of generations T1 to BC3 were ground to powder in liquid nitrogen, and the genomic DNA was extracted with the CTAB method. Genomic DNA of Zheng58 was used as the negative control. About 50 µg of genomic DNA was digested by EcoRI and HindIII and then separated on a 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel. The agarose gel was transferred onto a hybond-N+ nylon membrane (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) with a Trans-Blot SD system followed by UV-crosslinking. A digoxin-labeled probe containing a 800-bp fragment of bgl7Am was used for southern-blot hybridization. Immunologic process was conducted following the instructions of DIG-high prime DNA labeling and detection starter kit II (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).\n\n\nWestern blot analysis\nFive milligrams of lyophilized purified Bgl7A produced in Pichia pastoris GS115 [11] was used for the production of polyclonal antibody in rabbits. Recombinant proteins were extracted from seed meals. Kernels were ground with a high-throughput tissue homogenizer Geno/Grinder 2010 (SEPX CertiPrep, Metuchen, NJ).\nTo extract protein from seed meals, 30 mg of seed powder were placed into a 1.5-mL tube containing 300 µL extraction buffer (50 mM citric acid-Na2HPO4, pH 3.5). The tube was agitated on a shaker at room temperature for 1 h. After centrifugation at 5000× g for 10 min, the supernatant was incubated with 2-fold volume of pre-cooled acetone for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 14,000× g for 10 min. The protein precipitate was dissolved in 30 µL of deionized water, and the protein sample was divided into two equal parts. One was deglycosylated with endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (Endo H) according to the supplier's instructions (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), the other remained intact. Protein extract of purified Bgl7A from P. pastoris and Zheng58 were used as the positive and negative controls, respectively. Proteins from the stem, root and leaf of a transgenic plant of generation BC1 were extracted in the same way and used for tissue specificity analysis.\nProteins were separated on SDS–PAGE (12% acrylamide, 0.4% acryl-bisacrylamide). and transferred onto PVDF membrane (Pall, Port Washington, NY). The polyclonal antibody raised in rabbits was added into the membrane confining liquid for prehybridization. The goat anti-rabbit IgG labeled with alkaline phosphatase was used as the secondary antibody. BCIP/NBT kit (Zomanbio, Beijing, China) was used for color development. To identify the proteins, bands were excised from the gel and analyzed using matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) at Tianjin Biochip Corporation (Tianjin, China).\n\n\nβ-Glucanase activity assay and enzyme characterization\nCrude proteins of five randomly selected seeds were extracted with extraction buffer as described above, and the supernatant was subject to β-glucanase activity assay. β-Glucanase activity was determined by measuring the amount of reducing sugar released from lichenan with the method of 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) [11], [20]. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1 µmol of reducing sugar per minute from 1.0% lichenan in citric acid-Na2HPO4 (50 mM, pH 3.5) at 60°C for 10 min. β-Glucanase activities of generations T1, BC1, BC2 and BC3 of transgenic maize and Zheng58 were all evaluated. Each reaction and its control were run in triplicate. The enzyme properties of Bgl7AM derived from maize was determined using crude proteins from BC1 seeds as in Luo et al. (2010). The pH optimum of the protein was determined at 60°C and pH 1.0–6.0. The pH stability was determined by measuring the residual activity under standard conditions (pH 5.0, 60°C and 10 min) after pre-incubation at 37°C and pH 1.0–9.0 for 1 h. The optimal temperature was determined at 25–80°C at pH 5.0. Thermal stability of the enzyme was determined by assessing the residual enzyme activity under standard conditions after incubation of the enzyme at 70°C for various durations.\n\n\nEvaluation of anti-inactivation stability over feed pelleting process\nFeed pelleting was carried out with a twin-screw extruder (DSE-25 Extruder Lab-Station Brabender OHG, Duisburg, Germany). Part of the maize seeds were mixed and extruded at 70°C or 80°C, respectively. β-Glucanase activities and dry matter content (DM) values were determined before and after pelleting. Zheng58 seeds were treated as the non-transgenic control. Stability comparison was conducted with the β-glucanases derived from transgenic maize seeds and P. pastoris. Crude Bgl7A derived from P. pastoris with equal enzyme activity to transgenic maize was added into Zheng58 seeds, followed by pelleting treatment as described above. And the β-glucanase activity was detected after pelleting. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed using the Duncan's multiple-range test to compare treatment means. Significance was defined at P<0.05.\n\nResults\nConstruction and transformation of transgenic vector pHP20754-bgl7Am\nThe CAI value and GC content of bgl7A were 0.715 and 49.6%, respectively. After codon optimization and gene modification, the CAI value and GC content of bgl7Am was increased to 0.937 and 67.0%, respectively (Figure S1 and S2). These higher values are better for exogenous gene expression in maize. Furthermore, effective Nc, negative CIS elements, negative repeat elements, and mRNA structure of the target gene were also considered in gene modification (Figure S1, S2 and S3). As a result, native bgl7A and synthetic bgl7Am shared 82.2% nucleotide sequence identity but encoded identical amino acid sequences.\nThe 1221-bp bgl7Am was inserted into the expression vector pHP20754 between the embryo-specific ZM-leg1A promoter and ZM-leg1 terminator (Fig. 1b), which is a transcriptionally active spacer region that allows highly efficient transgene expression. The positive calli of maize Hi-II were regenerated on bialaphos medium and identified by PCR.\n\n\nPlant regeneration and phenotypic evaluation\nThe regenerated young plants described above showed good growth in the greenhouse. A total of 27 independent transgenic lines were obtained. Based on β-glucanase activities of the seeds, 330 seeds of three independent transgenic events (40, 46 and 51-1) were selected to cultivate in fields and backcross with Zheng58 for progeny production. As shown in Fig. 1c, the ears and seeds of generation T1 showed significant phenotypic difference from Zheng58. This difference was generally subsided in the later generations because of the successive backcrossing with Zheng58. Up to transgenic generation BC3, the traits of transgenic maize were almost the same as that of non-transgenic Zheng58 through visual observation. The result suggests that the inserted exogenous gene has no negative impact on the maize seed.\n\n\nDetermination of exogenous gene integration\nPCR assay with primers specific for bgl7Am was used to evaluate the inheritance of transgenic maize. Gene fragments of about 500 bp were detected in the transformation events 40, 46 and 51-1 (Fig. 2a). PCR results of actin gene (~300 bp) indicated the high quality of genomic DNA (Fig. 2b). To confirm the gene integration and the copy number of bgl7Am in transgenic plants, the genomic DNAs of three positive transgenic plants of event 40 were analyzed by southern blot after restriction digest with EcoRI and HindIII. The bgl7Am probe was prepared with a 800-bp fragment of the bgl7Am gene. There is only one EcoRI restriction site located between the promoter and the bgl7Am gene in the expression cassette of pHP20754-bgl7Am. A total of three bands of ~3.5, 5.0 and 6.0 kb, respectively, were detected in the positive lane via EcoRI digest, but not in non-transgenic Zheng58 (Fig. 2c). There is no HindIII site in the bgl7Am. While HindIII cut the gene expression cassette twice and released an internal fragment of 2.5 kb (Fig. 2c). These results indicate that there are three copies of bgl7Am in event 40.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 2.

In western blot analysis, no band was detected in the negative control of Zheng58 (Fig. 3a). The positive control, Bgl7A expressed by P. pastoris, showed a band of about 60 kDa, the same as that reported before [11]. One main band of ~60 kDa was identified on the PVDF membrane after hybridization with the antibody (Fig. 3a). This molecular weight (60 kDa) was much higher than the predicted molecular weight (45.3 kDa). After Endo H treatment, the band had no significant reduction in molecular weight (Fig. 3a). It suggested that other post-translation modifications rather than N-glycosylation, such as O-linked glycosylation, phosphorylation, acetylation or methylation, may occur in the transgenic maize. The band was verified to be Bgl7AM through MALDI-TOF-MS analysis (Figure S4). Except for the seeds, proteins extracted from the root, stem and leaf of the positive lines had no objective band (Fig. 3b), indicating the tissue specificity of Bgl7AM. Moreover, Bgl7AM present in seeds are more convenient for storage, transportation and direct utilization.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 3.

Approximately 200–400 seeds of each generation were assessed using the DNS method (Table 1). Compared with the non-transgenic Zheng58 that had β-glucanase activity of 3300 U/kg of seeds, T1 seeds (207,800 U/kg) showed approximately 63-fold activities of Zheng58. Both the maximal and average activities of BC1, BC2 and BC3 seeds were increased slightly. The maximal β-glucanase activity of BC3 seeds was up to 779,800 U/kg, which was 236 folds of that of Zheng58. About 47% of the seeds showed over 200,000 U/kg of β-glucanase activity. The result further confirmed that bgl7Am is genetically stable over generations in maize.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 1.  β-Glucanase activities of the transgenic maize seeds within four generations.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0081993.t001\n\nCharacterization of maize seed-derived Bgl7AM\nThe crude proteins of transgenic BC1 seeds were characterized (Fig. 4), and compared with Bgl7A of P. pastoris reported before [11]. Bgl7AM had a pH optimum at 4.0, while Bgl7A exhibited high activity at pH 1.5, 3.5 and 5.0 (maxima). Both enzymes remained active at pH 1.0–8.0. The temperature optimum of Bgl7AM was 70°C, which was 10°C higher than that of Bgl7A. Moreover, thermostability of Bgl7AM was improved. After incubation at 70°C for 15 min, Bgl7AM retained 50% of the initial activity while Bgl7A remained less than 30%.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 4.

The initial β-glucanase activities in transgenic line or in Zheng 58 by supplementation of Bgl7A were set to 77,860 U/kg and 85,350 U/kg, respectively. After pelleting at each of the tested temperatures, Bgl7A lost more activities than Bgl7AM. In combination with the data of enzyme characterization, Bgl7AM was more excellent than Bgl7A even though they had complete identical amino acid sequences.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 2.  Stability of of Bgl7A and Bgl7AM during feed pelleting*.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0081993.t002\nSo far several β-glucanase genes have been introduced into plants for different purposes. Endo-β-1,3-glucanase (laminarinase) can defend plants against fungal pathogens, introduction of its coding genes into crops is a plausible strategy to develop durable resistance against fungal pathogens [21]. Over the last two decades, transgenic plants harboring endo-β-1,4-glucanase (cellulase) genes have taken more attention for conversion of cellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars [22], [23]. Production of recombinant endo-β-1,4-glucanases E1 in transgenic plants have been reported in Arabidopsis [24], leaf and root tissues of maize [25], [26] and rice seeds [27]. Endo-β-1,3-1,4-glucanase (lichenase) is an important enzyme additive in monogastric animal feed to decompose β-glucan in cereals [3], [6], [28]. Up to now, β-1,3-1,4-glucanases have been expressed in transgenic barley [29], [30] and potato [31] for feed purpose. However, maize seed has never been used for production of endo-β-1,3-1,4-glucanase. Here we developed a transgenic maize line that overexpressed an endo-β-1,3-1,4-glucanase from Bispora sp. MEY-1 in seeds. Compared with enzyme production by microbial fermentation and other transgenic crops, transgenic maize seed has several advantages, such as low cost production, cultivation worldwide and direct utilization in animal feed. On the other hand, the genetic manipulation of maize is more easily. For feed industry's interest, maize seed as the major feed ingredient represents an ideal bioreactor to produce feed enzymes.About 65% of the maize seed produced in China is used as feed. If maize seeds express sufficient endo-β-1,3-1,4-glucanase, no supplementation of microbial glucanase will be required. To achieve high-level expression of bgl7Am in maize seed, several strategies have been utilized in combination, including a synthetic gene with preferred maize codons [15], a strong tissue-specific promoter, and an excellent transformation receptor with high competence and regeneration capacity that improves the transformation efficiency [13], [14]. As a result, the average and maximum glucanase activities in maize seeds without purification and enrichment were up to 239,300 and 779,800 U/kg seeds, respectively (Table 1). Previous feeding trials have shown that the effectiveness of glucanase as a feed additive was maximized at approximately 30,000 units per kg of diets [5]. Typically maize grains constitute 50% of the animal diet, thus the transgenic maize seeds having an average glucanase activity of 239,300 U/kg is high enough to substitute the glucanase supplement. When the transgenic maize line developed in this study is propagated in field, it will enhance the nutritive values of glucan-abundant grains such as wheat and barley. The development of transgenic maize will not only reduce the loss of resources and simplify the production process, but also provide an environmental friendly approach to produce enzymes.Moreover, Bgl7AM has good thermostability and excellent acidic stability, which are important factors for supplementation to animal feed. Thermostability is a key index of feed enzyme because of the high temperature during feed processing. Since most β-1,3-1,4-glucanases are not stable during coating of feed pellets (70–90°C), selection of a thermostable β-1,3-1,4-glucanase with high activity is of great interest to the animal feedstuff industries [8], [32], [33]. Bgl7AM retains most activities after pelleting at 80°C. This thermostability allows it to survive the heat generated from maize pressing into feed pellets and pasteurization. Similar results that plant-derived enzymes showed better stability have been reported. [34], [35]. This phenomenon might be ascribed to the different folding patterns and disulphide bond formations in microbes and plants [35]. Protection from maize seed starch might be the other cause.Furthermore, feed enzyme should be stable within the acid environment of monogastric animals' digestive tract, in which the pH value is lower than pH 3.0 in stomach (pH 1.3–3.5 for pigs and pH 2.8–4.8 for chickens) [36]. An acidic-tolerable β-glucanase has been isolated from Trichoderma koningii ZJU-T, with optimal activity at pH 2.0 [33]. Molecular modification approaches have been employed to enhance the activity of a β-1,3-1,4-glucanase at acidic pH [37]. Compared with counterparts, Bgl7AM is highly active and stable within pH 1.0–4.0, and retains above 90% of its activity at pH 3.0, the average pH in the animal digestive tract.This study provides an environment-friendly and low-cost approach to produce transgenic maize with social and ecological significance. It's the first report that produces a biologically active endo-β-1,3-1,4-glucanase in transgenic maize seeds. Approaches to increase the seed glucanase activities are preceding, including selection of more transgenic events and application of stronger promoters. In the future studies, we'll evaluate its direct application effectiveness in animal feed by comparison with traditional feed supplemented with glucanases."

                "Background: The real-time and continuous assessment of left ventricular (LV) myocardial contractility through an implanted device is a clinically relevant goal. Transvalvular impedance (TVI) is an impedentiometric signal detected in the right cardiac chambers that changes during stroke volume fluctuations in patients. However, the relationship between TVI signals and LV contractility has not been proven. We investigated whether TVI signals predict changes of LV inotropic state during clinically relevant loading and inotropic conditions in swine normal heart. Methods: The assessment of RVTVI signals was performed in anesthetized adult healthy anesthetized pigs (n = 6) instrumented for measurement of aortic and LV pressure, dP/dtmax and LV volumes. Myocardial contractility was assessed with the slope (Ees) of the LV end systolic pressure-volume relationship. Effective arterial elastance (Ea) and stroke work (SW) were determined from the LV pressure-volume loops. Pigs were studied at rest (baseline), after transient mechanical preload reduction and afterload increase, after 10-min of low dose dobutamine infusion (LDDS, 10 ug/kg/min, i.v), and esmolol administration (ESMO, bolus of 500 µg and continuous infusion of 100 µg·kg−1·min−1). Results: We detected a significant relationship between ESTVI and dP/dtmax during LDDS and ESMO administration. In addition, the fluctuations of ESTVI were significantly related to changes of the Ees during afterload increase, LDDS and ESMO infusion. Conclusions: ESTVI signal detected in right cardiac chamber is significantly affected by acute changes in cardiac mechanical activity and is able to predict acute changes of LV inotropic state in normal heart.

            "fulltext": "IntroductionThe ideal index of ventricular performance, which describes the pumping properties of the left ventricle, should be sensitive to changes of left ventricular (LV) inotropic state, independent of loading conditions, easily reproducible and safe [1]. Left ventricular pressure-volume (PV) loops are considered to be the gold standard for complete hemodynamic assessment during each cardiac cycle [2]–[3] and are widely used in research to evaluate the LV inotropic state and to quantify mechanical ventricular dyssynchrony in large animal model [4]–[5] and humans [6]–[7]. However, the PV loops assessment by conductance catheter is an invasive and complex approach, and its clinical application does not enable a permanent monitoring of ventricular contractility in patients with pacemaker implants.\nIn fact, the continuous real-time assessment of the LV myocardial contractility by an implanted device could provide useful information to calibrate the electrical stimulation in proportion to the real inotropic state of the heart and to monitor maladaptive hemodynamic response to electrical therapy of the heart [8] and the overall patient care [9]. Permanent pacemakers and defibrillators could be equipped with haemodynamic sensors suitable for diagnostic applications as well as for the autoregulation of the device itself [10]. At present, the haemodynamic guidance has been proposed in the adaptation of the pacing rate to the metabolic demand [11]–[15] and in atrio-ventricular (AV) and interventricular (VV) delay setting [16]–[18].\nThe signal of intracardiac impedance is a well known parameter for assessing in real time the acute changes of LV performance of failing heart at rest [19] and during adrenergic stress [17], [20]. Pacing leads bearing just standard electrodes can be used to assess cardiac impedance [21]. Different electrode arrangements are proposed for impedance assessment [17], [21]–[24], namely the unipolar configuration (current is applied between the ventricular tip electrode and the device case and the corresponding voltage drop is measured at the same spots), the bipolar configuration (current is applied between two cardiac electrodes and the corresponding voltage drop is measured at the same spots), or different multipolar configurations (current is applied between two cardiac electrodes and the voltage drop is measured on another electrode pair). The transvalvular impedance (TVI) is a particular example of bipolar configuration, where the atrial pole is represented by the ring electrode placed in right atrium and the ventricular pole by either the tip or ring electrode of the right ventricular lead. The timing of rise and decrease during the cardiac cycle suggests that TVI fluctuation reflects opposite changes in ventricular volume, as TVI increases in the ejection phase and decreases during ventricular filling [15], [25]–[27]. Since it is known the relationship between changes in right ventricular TVI and LV stroke volume (SV) during electrical and pharmacological stimulation in patients [25], it is unknown whether the RV TVI depends upon changes of LV inotropic state. In our study, we have analysed different TVI signals and performed a validation study of the end-systolic TVI (ESTVI) as index of LV contractility. For this purpose, we analysed ESTVI and simultaneous PV loops obtained by conductance catheter during different acute loading and inotropic conditions in healthy pigs.\nMaterials and Methods\nAnimal handling and instrumentation\nSix healthy sexually mature male farm pigs (35±2 kg, body weight), fasted overnight, were sedated with a cocktail of tiletamine hydrochloride and zolazepam hydrochloride (8 mg/kg i.m.) and\npremedicated with atropine sulfate (0.1 mg/kg). General anesthesia was subsequently induced with propofol (2–4 mg/kg) and maintained with 1% isoflurane in 60% air and 40% oxygen. Mechanical ventilation was adjusted based on arterial blood gas values [28]. Body temperature was maintained at 36.5°–39°C. Arterial pressure was measured via a fluid filled catheter inserted trough the right carotid artery and attached to a P23ID strain-gauge transducer; although, LV pressure, the maximum and minimum of the first derivative of LV pressure (dP/dtmax and dP/dtmin) and LV volume were measured using a pressure-volume conductance catheter (Millar Instruments Inc, Houston TX, USA) percutaneously inserted through the femoral artery and carefully advanced into the LV cavity under fluoroscopic guidance [29]. A 8F Fogarty large balloon occlusion catheter (Edwards Lifesciences, USA) was advanced into the inferior vena cava (IVC) through a right femoral venotomy; although, an additional large balloon catheter was advanced into the descending thoracic aorta trough the left carotid artery [29]. TVI was measured by standard leads for permanent pacing (Medico 366 and 400, Medico Spa, Padova, Italy) inserted trough the right external and internal jugular vein and advanced in right atrium and ventricular apex under fluoroscopic guidance. While the J-shaped atrial lead was positioned in the right appendage, the RV lead was positioned in the mid-low septum, as previously described in patients [25]–[27].\n\n\nHemodynamic measurements\nThe hemodynamic parameters were determined during one respiratory cycle and comprised the heart rate (HR), the mean arterial pressure (MAP), LV end-diastolic (EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV), LV end-diatsolic (EDP) and end-systolic pressure (ESP), the maximum derivative of change in pressure rise over time (dP/dtmax), the maximum derivative of change in pressure fall over time (dP/dtmin). The stroke volume (SV) was calculated as the difference between EDV and ESV. LV DP/dtmax is an index of the isovolumetric phase of the contraction, which is sensitive of preload, but not of afterload [30]. Conversely, the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR) (Ees) of the left ventricle was calculated using the first 7–10 beats during brief IVC occlusion [5]. Ees is an ejection phase measure of LV contractility, which is minimally affected by preload and afterload [31]. In addition, we measured the LV contractile state by calculation of LVESP/LVESV at each beat [1]. Effective arterial elastance (Ea) was calculated as an index of LV afterload [32]. The measurement of the area of the LV pressure-volume loop during a cardiac cycle was used as an index of stroke work (SW) [33].\nThe load-dependent and independent LV performance was evaluated simultaneously to the TVI measurement during each experimental condition. All hemodynamic signals were recorded on an eight-channel Gould polygraph recorder (model 5900; Gould Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA). The analogic signals were recorded through an analogic-digital interface (National Instruments), at a sampling rate of 250 Hz [4]. Digitized data were analysed off-line by custom-made software. Pressure–volume data were analysed off-line by a single observer. All conductance volumes were corrected for parallel conductance and the gain constant Î±.\n\n\nTVI measurements\nThe atrial and the ventricular pacing leads were connected in parallel with an external dual-chamber stimulator (PSA 490, Medico Spa, Padova, Italy) and with the custom-made TVI recorder. TVI was derived between the atrial ring and ventricular tip electrodes, applying subthreshold current pulses of 40 µA at 4 KHz. The waveform was sampled and stored at 1 KHz, together with the atrial and ventricular electrograms (AEGM, VEGM), one surface ECG lead, and one accessory signal (either LVP or LVV) derived as analog output of the PV recording equipment. All tracings were displayed in real-time and then analyzed off-line using commercial software (AcqKnowledge, Microsoft, USA). The VEGM signal represented the time marker of electrical ventricular activation and the trigger of TVI measurements. TVI increased in systole and decreased in diastole. The minimum and maximum values recorded in 500 ms after VEGM detection were considered, respectively, as the end-diastolic (ED) and ES TVI. The peak-to-peak TVI amplitude (pkpkTVI) was calculated as the difference between ESTVI and EDTVI. The ratio of the maximum TVI increase in 100 ms to the pkpkTVI in each cardiac cycle (TVI fractional change in 100 ms: TVIfc) represented an index of TVI rate of rise.\n\n\nExperimental Protocol\nThe experiments were conducted in anesthetized and hemodynamically stable animals. We first simultaneously measured hemodynamic and TVI parameters at rest. We accurately evaluated the feasibility of conductance catheter-derived P-V loops and TVI waveform during transient reduction of preload, acute increase of LV afterload, during low dose dobutamine stress (LDDS) and following esmolol infusion. Acute reduction of LV preload was induced by transient occlusion of the IVC via inflation of large balloon [4] in order to produce a 20% drop in systolic blood pressure [34]. Conversely, the brief inflation of the intra-aortic balloon afterwards induced a transient increase of LV afterload [34]. The LV function and TVI signals were afterwards assessed during transient inotropic stimulus by low dose dobutamine stress (LDDS, 10μg/kg/min i.v. for 10 minutes), as previously described [35]. LDDS is a well-established test used to provide a quantitative assessment of the LV contractile reserve in both large animal models [28], [35] and patients [36]–[37].\nAfter a 10-minute washout period, the TVI and hemodynamic parameters were evaluated during transient beta-adrenergic blockade induced by esmolol (bolus of 500μg and continuous infusion of 100 µg·kg−1·min−1 ), a cardioselective beta1 receptor blocker [38]. Basal measurements were repeated before any test in order to update all reference values. Once the experimental protocol was completed, the anesthetized pigs were euthanized with an intravenous injection of saturated KCl solution. Animal instrumentation and experimental protocol were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Italian Ministry of Health and was in accordance with the Italian law (DL-116, Jan. 27, 1992), which is in compliance with the National Institutes of Health publication Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\n\nStatistical Analysis\nAll data are mean values ± standard error of the mean. SPSS 11 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) was utilized for statistical analysis. Intragroup comparisons were performed using the one way analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni post-hoc pairwise multiple comparisons.\nThe changes of ESTVI, LVSV, dP/dtmax and LVESP/LVESV were calculated as the ratio between each parameter at baseline and during hemodynamic test. Correlations between groups of values were evaluated calculating the best fit, based on least-squares regression analysis. A good correlation was accepted at R value of ≥0.6. For all the statistical analyses, significance was accepted at P value of <0.05.\n\nResults\nHemodynamic and P-V loop analysis\nLeft ventricular function during changes in loading conditions. As shown in Table 1, MAP, LVESP, LVEDP, LVdP/dtmax, LVdP/dtmin, LVESV, LVEDV were significantly decreased during preload reduction in the presence of unchanged heart rate and reduced LVSV by 37.5±1.86% (p<0.05) compared to baseline (16±1.6 vs 24.5±1.5 ml). The LVESP/LVESV and LVSW were respectively reduced by 10.8±7.1 (p<0.05) and 55±15% (p<0.01) compared to normal loading conditions. Conversely, MAP, LVESP, LVdP/dtmax, LVdP/dtmin and LVESP/LVESV were significantly increased during afterload increase in the presence of reduced LVSV by 54.16±2.8% (p<0.01) compared to baseline (10.5±2 vs 24.5±1.5 ml) (Table 1). The LV Ees and Ea were respectively increased during afterload increase by 389.8±29.5 (p<0.00001) and 384.2±18.6 (p<0.001) compared to condition of reduced LV preload (Table 1).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 1.

The above TVI signals reached baseline values following complete IVC balloon deflation (data not shown). Conversely, the transient increase of the LV afterload caused a significant increase of EDTVI in the presence of unchanged ESTVI compared to baseline, yet the pk-pk TVI was reduced by 29±18.75% (Figure 1). As shown in Table 2 and Figure 1, the ESTVI was significantly reduced by 2.23±0.9% during LDDS in the presence of small reduction of EDTVI, and also the pk-pk TVI was reduced.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.

The direct relationship between ESTVI and LVdP/dtmax during preload reduction was significant and weak (Figure 2B). Conversely, ESTVI was directly and significantly related to dP/dtmax (Figure 2D) during LV afterload increase. As shown in Figure 3, we found a direct and significant correlation between changes in ESTVI and LVSV (Figure 3A) or dP/dtmax (Figure 3B) in response to LDDS. In addition, there was a direct a significant correlation between changes in ESTVI and dP/dtmax following esmolol infusion (Figure 3D). As shown in Figure 4B, C and D, we found a significant and direct correlation between ESTVI and LVEes during increasing of LV afterload, LDDS and esmolol infusion. No significant correlations were found between the abovementioned hemodynamic parameters and EDTVI or pk-pk TVI (data not shown).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 2.

Changes normalized to baseline values.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0080591.g004\nThe continuous and minimally invasive real-time assessment of the myocardial contractility is a clinically relevant issue, mainly in patients receiving a pacemaker-induced electrical stimulation of the heart. The implantable haemodynamic sensors, currently proposed for clinical use, are generally aimed at recording intracardiac pressure or other indirect markers of the cardiac contraction strength that have been correlated with the LV dP/dt max [39], [40]. However, dP/dt max is an index of the isovolumetric phase of the LV contractile function, which is more sensitive of preload and does not reflect the myocardial inotropism of the left ventricle [30]. Conversely, the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR) should be determined to measure the mechanical performance of the myocardium in a load-independent fashion [31–1] and to assess the properties of innovative inotropic sensors, such as TVI, under different hemodynamic conditions.In our experimental study, preload changes were induced by IVC occlusion that reduced venous return, RV filling and pulmonary output. A secondary decrease of LVSV, LVdP/dtmax, LVESP/LVESV and LVSW was clearly evident within 2 cycles after beginning balloon inflation. In this experimental condition, both EDTVI and ESTVI were increased, and pk-pkTVI was reduced (Figure 1). In the presence of preload reduction, we found that ESTVI significantly predicts the changes of LVSV (Figure 2A). Our experimental findings confirmed the inverse relationship between RVTVI and RV volume [15], [25]–[27]. In fact, TVI increased whenever the RV volume was supposed to decrease, providing correct information on relative changes in RV preload and stroke volume. However, ESTVI was not so sensitive to predict changes of LVdP/dtmax (Figure 2B) and Ees (Figure 4A) at that magnitude of preload reduction.After recovering the baseline hemodynamic values, an acute increase of LV afterload was obtained by partial occlusion of the thoracic aorta, which entailed a prompt rise in LV pressures and Ees. The LVSV was decreased and LVESV was increased compared to baseline. The acute reduction of the LV output caused a transient reduction of RV filling, with associated reduction in the pulmonary SV, which at the steady state must be equal to LVSV. In agreement with this model, the EDTVI and ESTVI were increased and pk-pkTVI was decreased (Figure 1). However, the ESTVI did not predict transient reduction of LVSV (Figure 2C) and LVdP/dtmax (Figure 2D) in the presence of increased isovolumetric contractility. Conversely, we found that ESTVI accurately predicts the increase of LV Ees during acute increase of LV afterload (Figure 4B).Changes in RV preload were generally coupled with corresponding LV SV modifications. However, the observed increase of ESTVI during rise of LV afterload probably was mostly related to the reduction of RV preload. Knowledge of TVI changes under different hemodynamic conditions might allow a comprehensive interpretation of simultaneous modifications in the contraction strength. It could be essential in the regulation of the AV delay in a dual-chamber stimulator, which usually aims at the optimal ventricular filling (i.e.: the highest possible preload).The direct relationship found between ESTVI and LVEes during inflation of the aortic balloon suggested ESTVI as potential index of LV inotropic state. For this purpose, we performed the abovementioned measurements during selective inotropic conditions.Low dose dobutamine stimulation induced a marked positive inotropic response characterized by the expected significant increase of LV pressures, stroke work and LVEes. In spite of the clear-cut effects on pressure-related parameters, the LVSV was not significantly increased compared to baseline, probably due to the high cardiac rate and consequent shortening of the total filling time. We observed, in fact, a small reduction of the ESTVI and EDTVI in the presence of unchanged pk-pk TVI compared to baseline condition. However, we observed that ESTVI accurately predicts changes of LV contractility (Figures 3B) during positive inotropic stimulus even in the absence of significant preload changes. Our experimental data confirmed previous study demonstrating that dobutamine markedly increases RV contractility and intracardiac impedance [39]. In order to better validate the inotropy-sensing of the ESTVI, we repeated the TVI and PV loops assessment following the administration of esmolol, a selective blocker of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors type 1. Esmolol induced a large reduction of LV dP/dt max, SW ad Ees in the presence of marked reduction of LVSV. Surprisingly, we observed a significant reduction of ESTVI and EDTVI in the presence of unchanged pk-pk TVI. In addition, we found a direct and significant correlation between changes of ESTVI and LV dP/dtmax (Figure 3D) or LV Ees (Figure 4D). On the basis of our results, we suppose that the SV-ESTVI inverse relationship was unpredictable in the presence of negative inotropic stimulus (LVEes < 2 mmHg/ml) and reduced preload. Since changes of myocardial electrical activity does not affect myocardial electrical impedance measurements [41], it is conceivable that the changes of ES TVI signals in the presence of blocks of cardiac beta-1 adrenoreceptors mainly reflect changes of myocardial impedance rather than right ventricular blood pool impedance. In our experimental model, the infusion of esmolol could have compromised contractile function to such an extent as to cause the formation of moderate myocardial edema [42], which is expected to reduce the myocardial electrical impedance [43]. This finding supports ESTVI as sensor of myocardial contractile function related to changes of myocardial impedance.Our findings are encouraging and suggest that ESTVI has good potential for use in the permanent beat-by-beat surveillance of the LV inotropic state in patients with pacemakers. However, there is still much investigation required before ESTVI is considered a reliable sensor of LV inotropic state in the presence of disarrangement of myofilaments, myocardial dyssynchrony or heart failure.The study was performed in the presence of intrinsic AV conduction. It remains to be established whether the TVI properties reported in this study might be affected by changes in right ventricular pacing."

                "Background: Youngsters with unilateral congenital below-elbow deficiency (UCBED) seem to function well with or without a prosthesis. Reasons for rejecting prostheses have been reported earlier, but unfortunately not those of the children themselves. Furthermore, reasons for acceptance are underexplored in the literature. Objectives: To investigate opinions of children and early and late adolescents with UCBED, and those of their parents and healthcare professionals, concerning (1) reasons to wear or not to wear prostheses and (2) about rehabilitation care. Methods: During one week of online focus group interviews, 42 children of 8–12 y/o, early and late adolescents of 13–16 and 17–20 y/o, 17 parents, and 19 healthcare professionals provided their opinions on various topics. This study addresses prosthetic use or non-use of prosthetics and rehabilitation care. Data were analyzed using the framework approach. Results: Cosmesis was considered to be the prime factor for choosing and wearing a prosthesis, since this was deemed especially useful in avoiding stares from others. Although participants functioned well without prostheses, they agreed that it was an adjuvant in daily-life activities and sports. Weight and limited functionality constituted rejection reasons for a prosthesis. Children and adolescents who had accepted that they were different no longer needed the prosthesis to avoid being stared at. The majority of participants highly valued the peer-to-peer contact provided by the healthcare professionals. Conclusions: For children and adolescents with UCBED, prostheses appeared particularly important for social integration, but much less so for functionality. Peer-to-peer contact seemed to provide support during the process of achieving social integration and should be embedded in the healthcare process. "

            "fulltext": "IntroductionCongenital upper limb defects affect between 19.5 and 21.5 births per 10,000 [1], [2]. A considerable group of congenital upper limb anomalies result in reduction deficiencies (5.56 births per 10,000) [3]. Children with such impairments often receive prosthetic treatment in order to improve their functionality and to avoid developmental problems [4]. It is doubtful that prostheses fulfill these aims, since the rejection rate is high 35–45% [5], while no difference in functionality is seen between prostheses wearers and non-wearers [6], [7]. Furthermore, prosthesis use seems to reduce manipulation, exploration, variation, and adaptation in the daily-life activities of young children with unilateral congenital below-elbow deficiency (UCBED) [8]. By developing compensatory strategies and auxiliary movements using other body parts (e.g., head, legs, and trunk) to perform a task [9], children also tend to be more independent without prostheses [4]. Thus it is still unclear why some continue wearing prostheses.\nProstheses are typically accepted when people with upper limb impairment face a great deal of difficulty in daily-life activities, have a higher level of amputation (above the elbow), when the abilities of the prostheses are considered to be “fair,” and when wearers are satisfied, in general, with their healthcare [10]–[12]. Advantages of early fitting with a prosthesis in children with UCBED are inconclusive in the literature [13]–[15] and are not associated with satisfaction with the prosthesis, functional use of the prosthesis, or motor skills [16].\nProstheses are often rejected when people do not experience many challenges in daily-life activities, have lower levels of amputation, are unsatisfied with certain features of the prostheses (sweating, cosmesis, or interface discomfort), or are unsatisfied with all healthcare areas (i.e., fitting, follow-up, repair, training, and information provision) [10]–[12]. Abnormal truncal movements that usually accompany the performance of activities in prosthetic users may also determine the rejection of prostheses [17]. Parents also play a role in the rejection of prostheses mostly because of disappointment with the limited benefits of prostheses, insufficient involvement in the treatment, and disappointment regarding socio-emotional guidance [13].\nThe literature is generally concerned with the reasons for rejection of prostheses in adults and provides abundant information as to quantitative outcomes. Information on self-reported reasons that elucidate why children and early and late adolescents choose or continue to wear a prosthesis is scarce. Knowing how psychosocial factors, vis-à-vis the more technical aspects, contribute to the rejection or acceptance of the prosthesis would be of great interest. Children’s and adolescents’ ideas about what aspects could be improved in a prosthesis have yet to be investigated. The rationale or role of the parents in choosing a prosthesis or in the decision to wear one is also unclear. The approach healthcare professionals take toward improving children’s quality of life, including prosthetic prescription, has been previously described [18]–[20]. Nevertheless, there is not much information about patients’ feedback about rehabilitation care, especially the feedback from children. Therefore, the direction of the current study is aimed at elucidating these aspects of how youngsters with UCBED function; the means chosen is a qualitative study design.\nThe aims of this study are (1) to investigate the opinions of children and early and late adolescents with UCBED, and that of their parents and professionals as to the reasons to wear or not to wear prostheses, and their opinions about (2) rehabilitation care, and to compare the differences in opinions and perspectives among children, early and late adolescents, parents, and healthcare professionals.\nMethodsThe current study is a part of a larger study which focused on the aspects of functioning of children and adolescents with UCBED: activities, participation, prosthetic use or non-use, psychosocial functioning, and rehabilitation care. The results concerning activities and participation, and those concerning psychosocial functioning have been published by De Jong and colleagues [21], [22]. The aim of this published first study was to assess whether youngsters with UCBED encounter activity or participation limitations and, if so, what are their coping strategies for those limitations. The published second study investigated the psychosocial functioning of youngsters with UCBED, with a focus on their feelings about their deficiency and what their coping strategies are in terms of those feelings. The larger study as a whole was designed as a qualitative research study, using online focus group interviews for the data collection.\n\n1 Study Design\nQualitative studies offer the possibility of gaining insight into underexplored research topics. Online focus group interviews are useful for exploring opinions, for obtaining a range of views from different age categories, and for observing interactions among a wide range of participants. Compared to classic face-to-face focus groups, the online version offers anonymous participation which minimizes the influence of social pressure and favors a more open interaction; it provides a comfortable environment, and by avoiding the transcription process is inexpensive and time-efficient [23]–[25]. Online focus group interviews were considered appropriate for this study, because they are specifically suitable when rare diseases are the subject of interest and participants live in a widespread area. A group of 8 to 15 participants is believed to work successfully in asynchronous focus groups [26]–[28], and even 19 participants have been used in online settings [29].\n\n\n2 Ethics Statement\nEthical approval was obtained from the Medical Ethical Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands (number M09.079327). Each participant or child’s parent/guardian provided an informed consent, and completed a demographic questionnaire prior to the beginning of the study. For the participation of the youngsters in the study, informed consent was obtained from the parents/guardians of those participants aged 8–11 y/o, from the participants aged 12–17 y/o and also from their parents/guardians, and it was obtained from the participants only, when aged 18–20 y/o. Regardless of whether their child actually participated, parents/guardians signed a separate informed consent allowing their own participation in the focus group interviews.\nThe participants were informed that they could contact an independent physician for any distress they experienced and that they could withdraw from the study at any time without any consequences. The confidentiality of the participant was also ensured by assigning a codename (for example, children were given names of types of fruit) to every participant. These codenames were used by the participants during the study and for the purpose of analysis. The credentials of the participants were accessible only to the researchers and to no one else.\n\n\n3 Population\nFive categories of participants were considered: children, early and late adolescents, parents, and healthcare professionals who had worked with the UCBED population.\n3.1 Inclusion criteria for children and early and late adolescents.Purposive sampling was used [30], meaning that both prosthetic wearers and non-wearers with particular characteristics were selected: (1) aged between 8 and 20 years old, and (2) UCBED at a transradial level with a non-syndromic cause. Three categories were defined in concordance with school age: children aged 8–12 years old (primary school), early adolescents aged 13–16 years old (secondary school), and late adolescents aged 17–20 years old (secondary or higher education). By grouping participants in age categories, we aimed to detect specific age-related opinions on the research topics.\n\n3.2 Inclusion criteria for parents and healthcare professionals.Eligible parents were those whose children met the criteria of inclusion for children and early and late adolescents. Eligible healthcare professionals were those with work experience with the UCBED pediatric group.\n\n3.3 Exclusion criteria.Individuals with insufficient proficiency in the Dutch language and limited mental capacity were excluded.\n\n3.4 Recruitment.Participants (except for healthcare professionals) were recruited through national rehabilitation centers and patient organizations. Patient organizations advertized the study on their websites and in newsletters. Twenty-five random people per group were approached, taking into account age, gender, prosthetic wearing/non-wearing, and referral center. Participants received a package with detailed information, a form for informed consent, and a letter approved by the attending rehabilitation physician stating that the physician supports the study and inviting the child or the parent to participate. Professionals were approached through rehabilitation centers and orthopedic workshops in the Netherlands.\n\n\n\n4 Procedure\nAn expert provided methodological recommendations for designing and conducting the online focus group interviews. A website with five forums, one forum per group, was designed to facilitate the online focus group interviews. Participants were able to log in anonymously and post messages at any time of the day they preferred and from the location they preferred, within the timeframe of one week. Participants were instructed to omit names of people or rehabilitation centers.\nA question about a specific topic was posted every morning during the first five days. The last two days were assigned to open discussions between group participants. The participants who did not access the website on a particular day would receive a reminder the following day asking them to answer not only the current day’s question but also the question from the previous day. The participants were required to post at least one message as an answer to each of the five questions.\nThis study addressed aspects of the prosthetic use or non-use (day 3) and rehabilitation care (day 5), formulating queries as follows: “Tell us why you wear or do not wear a prosthesis,” “Tell us how you evaluate the rehabilitation team and technicians,” and “Do you have suggestions for improvement for them?” The rest of the topics were covered on other days: activities (day 1), participation (day 2), and psychosocial functioning (day 4).To ensure the correct understanding of the questions, the authors formulated them according to the participant’s age. The study questions and the website with its five forums were pilot-tested on a group of non-impaired children and independent adults. Minor difficulties with understanding the questions and with using the forums were encountered during the pilot test. The website and the questions were improved based on participants’ suggestions. To enable the comparison of perspectives between groups, parents and professionals were asked to express their feedback from the child’s perspective. Multiple perspectives are important for gaining a richer and broader understanding of the studied population [27], and to help clinicians find suitable solutions for the barriers experienced by the parties dealing with UCBED, that is, children, early and late adolescents, parents, and healthcare professionals.\nIn order to cover a broad area of interest, the questions were based on the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for Children and Youth (ICF-CY). ICF-CY addresses issues on two levels: functioning and disability (body functions, body structures, activities, and participation), and contextual factors (environmental and personal factors) [31].\nIn order to address a possible bias induced by the lack of nonverbal communication, emoticons were made available. This enabled participants to express their feelings. Two moderators were online every day of the study from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. to ensure that the online focus group interviews were conducted properly. They (IdJ and HRM) followed the moderator’s principles [32] to allay some of the moderator’s influences. The two moderators facilitated an interactive discussion between participants, but avoided influencing or dominating the discussions. Moderators refrained from rephrasing and evaluating statements; instead, they repeated comments using the participant’s words, and provided positive reinforcement by using neutral comments and probing. Both moderators were experienced in the field of child and hand rehabilitation, in addition to a background in human movement sciences, and were not involved in the treatment of the participants. HRM had experience with qualitative data collection methods in pediatric populations. Moderators were in contact, during the study period, with a very experienced rehabilitation physician working with this type of patient. Whenever clarifications of an answer were needed or new information/issues appeared, moderators posted additional questions to individual or all participants until no other new information appeared. This is similar to reaching data saturation [30]. All the data is available in the Dutch language or, if requested, a translation in English can be provided as well.\n\n\n5 Data Analysis\nThe most common methods in healthcare research used to analyze qualitative data are thematic analysis, grounded theory, and the framework approach [33]. The framework approach enables, as does thematic analysis, the corroboration of predefined research questions with the themes that emerge in the study. The advantage, however, is that it starts deductively from the clearly predefined objectives of the study, and is systematic and transparent, allowing easy access to the analytical process for the researcher as well as for other people [34]. The framework approach was used to analyze the data from this study. The approach contains five steps in which data is screened, condensed, and mapped into a thematic framework:\n5.1 Familiarization.The data generated on the days allocated to prosthetic use and rehabilitation care were read by three authors (EV, HRM, and CvdS). The rest of the data was also read to extract remarks about prosthetic use and rehabilitation care. Key ideas and themes were identified in a meeting with the three authors. The themes were derived from subjects frequently mentioned by the participants.\n\n5.2 Identifying a thematic framework.A coding framework was developed by EV to structure the collected information around key issues and themes (Table S1). Based on the aims of the study, the themes were grouped into main categories such as “reasons to wear a prosthesis,” “reasons not to wear a prosthesis,” or “tips for making a prosthesis better, adaptive devices, and other creative solutions.” In addition, for each main category a “general” theme category was created for data not matching the other themes. The data in the “general” theme category (e.g., frequency, time and place for wearing the prosthesis) when considered appropriate were made available in the Results section to provide detailed information for the themes.\n\n5.3 Indexing.EV and HRM tested the coding framework on ten percent of the data. After discussing minor differences in the manner of coding, agreement was reached upon the final version of the coding framework. EV correlated text pieces from the entire dataset with the appropriate code.\n\n5.4 Charting.EV displayed the pieces of text corresponding to the matched code and affiliation group in the form of a matrix. The columns contained the framework themes, while the lines contained each participant’s quotes on the theme. The quotes of wearers or non-wearers were thus easily identifiable from the matrix. The data accessibility of the matrix facilitated the analysis of the perspectives of the different groups, and of wearers and non-wearers.\n\n5.5 Mapping and interpretation.The resulting matrix was verified for the correct code by HRM and CvdS. In order to draw conclusions, EV, HRM, and CvdS analyzed the matrix separately. All three discussed the similarities and differences that occurred. Consensus was found on interpretations and conclusions.\n\n\nResultsFrom the total of 125 eligible participants, 77 (62%) participated in the study. Forty-two were either children, early adolescents, or late adolescents; 16 were parents; and 19 were healthcare professionals. No differences in age, gender, and provenance center were found between participants and non-participants. Non-wearers were represented by participants who had experience with prostheses (children 47%, early adolescents 54%, late adolescents 58%, and children of parents 63%), and participants without previous prosthetic experience (Table 1). Myoelectric prostheses were the most popular among wearers (Table 1). The healthcare professionals group consisted of five physiatrists, six occupational and physical therapists, six certified prosthetists, and two psychologists.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 1.  Characteristics of participants (n = 77).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0067101.t001The participants were active in interacting with each other and with moderators. Each participant posted at least one message as an answer to each study question. Parents and healthcare professionals provided the most extensive answers.\n\n1 Reasons to Choose and Wear Prostheses\n1.1 Cosmetic, social, emotional, and identity reasons.Prostheses were chosen and worn primarily to provide cosmesis. Cosmesis helped participants of all age categories to manage relationships with the people in their environment. A frequently mentioned reason was to prevent adverse reactions like teasing and staring. For children, the prosthesis also offered a normal body appearance, while for early and late adolescents wearing a prosthesis allowed them to establish a good first impression and gave them a feeling of self-confidence.\n\n“For walking on the street I found it [the prosthesis] enjoyable; everyone finds you normal then, because you then have two hands.” (10 y/o girl, non-wearer with prosthesis experience)\n\nThe prostheses were worn every day, yet limited to being worn in public. In a safe home environment, the prosthesis had nothing to add and was therefore removed. The cosmesis also became more important during transitional periods such as puberty.\n\n“At puberty, I noticed that they ask for it [the prosthesis] from a cosmetic point of view… They especially want a prosthesis, for example, when they go to secondary school.” (Healthcare professional)\n\nProfessionals noticed that rejection of prosthesis use occurred in some children as soon as they became accustomed to a new environment.\n\n1.2 Functionality, manipulation, dexterity reasons.Along with cosmesis, functionality was important for children and adolescents in the process of choosing and wearing prostheses. Being able to experience activities of daily life in a normal way, to grip with the impaired upper limb, and curiosity about whether the prosthesis offered more dexterity also led participants to opt for prostheses.\n\n“A cosmetic prosthesis often has to be practical too; that’s why children/adolescents often want a myo [myoelectric prosthesis] then.” (Healthcare professional)\n“I wanted to know if it would be handy or not to wear a prosthesis. I wanted to try and become handier so that everything might be a bit easier. ” (13 y/o girl, non-wearer with prosthetic experience)\n\nWearers and non-wearers regarded the prosthesis as a “useful help accessory” for activities like managing school tasks, cutting, grasping, holding, and lifting.\nActivity-specific use was noticed in early and late adolescents for activities such as cycling and driving more safely, or for leisure purposes such as playing sports like volleyball, hockey, and football.\nAt other times, participants managed to function perfectly well without prostheses. However, activities such as lifting heavy objects, playing sports like volleyball or hockey, or doing some jobs such as delivering newspapers were not performed without prostheses by several early adolescents.\n\n1.3 Physical reasons.Some prosthetic wearers in every group considered wearing a prosthesis as something beneficial for muscle development, locomotion, posture, and balance.\n\n“When I play soccer, I have my prosthesis on… I have the feeling that I have better balance with it [the prosthesis] on and that I can manage better if I fall.” (16 y/o girl, wearer)\n\n\n1.4 Parents and prosthesis choice.Wearers in children’s and late adolescent groups specified that they had been too young to make the choice on their own when the choice was initially made. Parents had therefore played an important role in the process of acquisition and wearing of prostheses.\nSome parents had based their choice on the information and instructions about the benefits of early fitting that they had received from healthcare professionals. Other parents had followed their personal beliefs. They wanted to give the child the opportunity to experience a prosthesis so as to provide him/her with the knowledge to be able to make an informed choice later in life. Another reason for parents to choose a prosthesis for their child was that they had wanted to overcome the emotional stress of having a child with an upper-limb impairment.\n\n“When she was little, we allowed our daughter to use a prosthesis in the morning and go without the prosthesis in the afternoon. This way she could discover herself what was most suitable for her.” (Parent of a 13 y/o girl, non-wearer with prosthetic experience)\n“There are parents that want a prosthesis per se, because that way they see their child as more complete, and they find it less difficult for themselves and the family.” (Healthcare professional)\n\n\n\n\n2 Reasons not to Choose and Wear Prostheses\n2.1 Cosmetic, social, emotional, and identity reasons.Child non-wearers confronted the staring issue head on. They wanted acceptance and respect from the environment without having to wear a prosthesis. Early adolescents experienced self-confidence and self-identity without a prosthesis. Professionals explained this self-confidence on the part of adolescents as a result of realizing that they were able to perform everything just as well without the prosthesis.\nLate adolescents, non-wearers, had negative feelings regarding the prosthesis. For them, the prosthesis was a statement about being disabled by highlighting the upper limb defect.\n\n“I felt myself disabled with that thing [the prosthesis] on… When I was wearing it, I had the feeling that it even made me stand out more [than without the prosthesis].” (20 y/o girl, non-wearer with prosthetic experience)\n\nNon-wearers with or without prosthetic experience reached the stage of accepting their situation. The prosthesis could not substitute for a real hand; it was “a dead thing” or “a doll’s hand,” and it did not belong to the child. In that sense, the cosmesis of a prosthesis lost its value.\n\n“I did not want it [the prosthesis] anymore and I thought, ‘I am how I am,’ and that worked just as well.” (9 y/o girl, non-wearer with prosthetic experience)\n“I never wanted it [the prosthesis] before, because I considered it a fake hand… I’m also not ashamed about it [the affected hand] [smiley face].” (11 y/o boy, non-wearer without prosthetic experience)\n\n\n2.2 Functionality, manipulation, dexterity reasons.Children and adolescents felt more functional, more dexterous, or faster without prostheses. The majority of non-wearers were able to perform “everything and more” without the prosthesis. Parents and professionals noticed that children and adolescents saw little or no functional value in wearing prostheses.\n\n“Meanwhile he [parent’s child] is at an age now (8 y/o), at which he has become very dexterous with his arm … He doesn’t see his [affected] arm as a limitation and I think for him walking around with a prosthesis the whole day has no added value.” (Parent of an 8y/o boy, non-wearer with prosthetic experience)\n\nWearers, on the other hand, specified that they did not use their prostheses for activities like eating, playing, tying shoelaces, manual work at school, or working with a computer, because they were more dexterous or had better grip without them.\n\n“I’ve been able to tie my shoelaces with and without a prosthesis since I was 3! I find it easier without the prosthesis, because then I have more grip on the lace.” (15 y/o girl, wearer)\n\n\n2.3 Technical and interface reasons.The most often mentioned complaint and reason for not wearing the prosthesis was a prosthesis’s weight. The myoelectric prosthesis often required extra support with the sound hand to counterbalance the weight. Discomfort caused by the interface contact with the stump or the technical limitations of the prosthesis itself were also discussed. The interface caused stump irritations, sweating, bad odor, and difficulties fixing the stump in the socket.\n\n“I found it annoying that the prosthesis was just stuck on my arm, and it [the arm] was sweating, and that’s why it [the prosthesis] was difficult at first to put on and off.” (10 y/o girl, non-wearer with prosthetic experience)\n\nThe prosthesis had a limited number of movements and grip functions. Other complaints of non-wearers include the presence of liners, frequent technical failure, and damaged or dirty gloves. Putting on and taking off were perceived as a difficult and laborious process. Manufacturing times were considered long, and learning to use a prosthesis was energy- and time-consuming.\nTechnical issues were not considered by the wearers to be reason enough not to wear prostheses, but rather as aspects that needed improvement.\n\n2.4 Physical reasons.Non-wearers were very disturbed by the lack of sensorial feedback from the stump, along with arm and shoulder fatigue, and pain from using prostheses.\n\n“My arm was really tired after a day wearing a prosthesis and without [the prosthesis] not at all. With the prosthesis on, my shoulder used to start hurting easily. Were these reasons, a tired arm and pain in the shoulder, the most important reasons to stop wearing the prosthesis? Yes, actually they were.” (16 y/o girl, non-wearer with prosthetic experience)\n\n\n2.5 Parents and the prosthesis choice.Parents who did not opt for a prosthesis for their child made this choice because they “first wanted to see his [child’s] functionality without a prosthesis.” Other parents considered a prosthesis to be useless, based on users’ stories about daily-life experiences with prostheses.\n\n\n\n3 Tips for Improving Prostheses\nLate adolescents, parents, and professionals suggested lowering the costs of prostheses. Furthermore, they desired prostheses that were lighter, more attractive, easier to manipulate, and that had more hand positions and separate finger movements, sensorial feedback, and better glove quality. The harnesses on body-powered prostheses seemed to be very annoying, especially for boys:\n\n“Harnesses can indeed be a problem, particularly among boys that want to get rid of the ‘bra’ […].” (Healthcare professional)\n\nAlternatives for prosthetic wearing.The participants were creative in developing alternatives to wearing prostheses. The children or their relatives developed special techniques using body parts such as stump, head, trunk, mouth, or knees, and creative strategies such as bandages or tape to tie an object around the stump or to tie a magnet to it for holding objects.\nAdaptive devices for the arm or prosthesis received a lot of attention among participants, especially for non-wearers with or without prosthetic experience, and were described as helpful tools for performing specific activities such as cycling, eating, playing sports, and playing a musical instrument. Professionals and parents suggested developing more adaptive devices, although it appeared to be difficult to get the costs of adaptive devices reimbursed.\n\n\n\n4 Rehabilitation Care\n4.1 General opinions.The participants generally experienced good rehabilitation care. Many late adolescents were neutral, perceived the care as appropriate, or could not recall how they had felt about it. The participants had received proper guidance in choosing a prosthesis and had been adequately informed about functioning with a short arm and with a prosthesis.\n\n4.2 Peer contact.A recurrent theme in all groups was peer-to-peer contact. Parents with young children were eager to know what the possibilities and limitations were for their child in terms of normal functioning and development. Parents received answers to these questions during meetings with peer parents. Emotional support from experienced parents diminished the anxiety of less-experienced parents.\n\n“We saw children in the peer-group meetings who were older [than their child] and they told us how they had found a solution for all the little problems. We benefited a lot from this and we still really enjoy going to these meetings… I think it can be very comforting for ‘new’ parents to have contact right away with ‘experienced’ parents so that a lot of the anxiety is taken away.” (Parent of a 13 y/o boy, wearer)\n\nChildren and early adolescents also benefitted from peer-to-peer contact. Children referred to those meetings as “fun-time.” Emotional support was offered even during the course of the online focus group to one child who was going through a difficult time.\n\n“Right now I don’t want to be around other children.” (9 y/o boy, non-wearer with prosthetic experience)\nReaction from a participant: “I think it’s sad that ‘codename’ [referring to the previous participant] is so sad; you’ve got to remember that you’re perfect the way you are. [sad face]” (11 y/o boy, non-wearer without prosthetic experience)\n\nEarly adolescents added that the meetings were informative and emotionally helpful for them. They found out more about novel prostheses and solutions for performing difficult activities.\n\n“I go about once a year to the meetings. I am the oldest one there, and so many people ask me things. I like this and also learn things, because they [other participants] help you with new things and improvements.” (14 y/o girl, wearer)\n\nThe online focus group was seen by the children and early adolescents as an opportunity to share information about ways to perform certain activities like playing a musical instrument, playing sports, or tying shoelaces.\n\n4.3 Psychosocial assistance.Some children regarded the psychologist as vague and found the psychological tests unpleasant, or they simply did not want to talk and answer the question, “How are you doing?” However, early adolescents and parents mentioned that emotional and psychosocial help from the rehabilitation team was useful when they encountered difficult moments.\n\n“I always enjoyed an hour with the social worker the most, always nice talks, and she helped me at the same time with things that were difficult for me at that time, such as bullying and other things.” (16 y/o girl, non-wearer with prosthetic experience)\n\nProfessionals all agreed that psychosocial disciplines are an important and valuable part of the rehabilitation treatment.\n\n4.4 Themes discussed by professionals.Professionals recognized that the clients’ expectations were often too high. Children or their parents believed that a prosthesis could solve their problems with the short arm, but the outcome was not always the one they had aimed for.\nAlthough professionals admitted that the current tendency of healthcare providers was to prescribe prostheses, and that more practice was needed until the child performed automatically with the prosthesis, some professionals had different ideas.\n\n“I think that if you consider providing a prosthesis, then you should at least ensure that the child is not clumsier with a prosthesis than without it; so practicing is needed until his prosthesis can be pretty automatically manipulated.” (Healthcare professional)\n\nThey stated that the team should not strive for bilateral handling of UCBED children, but that the child should grow up with a positive self-image and should be able to fulfill his wishes with or without a prosthesis. These professionals realized that they should listen carefully to the client’s needs and to the strategies they had already found on their own, and should avoid imposing their own knowledge excessively.\n\n\nThe children and adolescents with UCBED interviewed in our study seemed to choose and wear prostheses mostly for cosmetic reasons in order to avoid people staring at them. In adults with upper limb amputation, similar [35]–[37] and opposite outcomes were found (i.e., cosmesis was less important) [38]. On the other hand, our findings acknowledged that poor prosthetic cosmesis influenced the non-choice and rejection of the prosthesis [10], [13]. The authors of a systematic review noticed a trend in qualitative studies in terms of reporting about the importance of cosmesis [39]. This being the case, the cosmetic aspects of prostheses in youngsters with UCBED deserve the full attention of manufacturers and of those recommending or prescribing them.In terms of the World Health Organization’s ICF classification, children and adolescents with UCBED have a body structure impairment [31]. Therefore, one might expect their functionality to be affected as well. However, the results of our study suggest that the functionality of children and adolescents is good, since many were able to perform activities with or without prostheses; this idea is supported in the literature as well [6], [7]. The use of creative strategies (using sweatbands and/or other body parts for grasping and holding objects in place, choosing easier activities) to facilitate activities and participation in daily living may be an alternative to the use of prostheses [22].In contrast to people with acquired arm amputations, children and adolescents with UCBED have no “sense of loss” regarding the short arm [40]. If children and adolescents with UCBED argue that they do not experience activity limitations and participation restrictions and have no “sense of loss,” then there is no reason for them to believe they have an impairment and to feel disabled. However, there are mechanisms that make these youngsters aware of the impairment. Along with body structures and functions, activities and participation, the ICF considers the environmental and the personal factors [31]. Environmental and the personal factors (gender, educational level, ability to adjust) may influence participation of people with amputations [41] and our findings support this.When the children and adolescents with UCBED in our study did start to use prostheses, people from their close environment (parents, healthcare professionals) or from their external environment (strangers) exerted a great influence in this regard. Providing the child with a prosthesis in order to improve functionality or to disguise the impairment may be considered as strategies on the part of the parents to cope with their child being disabled. These strategies have been previously described [19], [42]. Later on, when children and early and late adolescents become aware of the impact exerted by the short arm on their life, they find solutions to the problems they encounter. In addition to dealing with staring and hostile reactions from people, people with impairment of the upper limb have to deal with their own identity and values concerning body image, sexuality, and career [40]. This is the moment when cosmesis becomes more important and influences the choice of a prosthesis.In the context of prosthetic use for cosmetic purposes, the concept of normality becomes a matter for discussion. One way to achieve normality for people with disabilities is to adjust and to fit into society [43]. In the research we conducted, participants of all ages experienced a need for normality, especially during transitional periods (a new school or applying for a job), which has been reported in previous studies as stressful events [40], [44], [45]. Therefore, more psychological attention and information about cosmetic options is needed from healthcare providers, especially in critical transitional phases like puberty.For many children and adolescents in the study, the way to adjust to the environment and to ensure normality was to wear prostheses so as to appear bodily complete. Being able to perform daily, leisure, and school activities in the same way as their non-disabled peers may also be considered a form of normality. In these circumstances, the prosthesis seems to represent a source of empowerment that facilitates integration into society [43]. For a balanced relationship between youngsters with UCBED and their environment, it would also be appropriate for those people in their environment to adjust their way of thinking, perceiving, and approaching youngsters with UCBED.Another way of achieving normality is to accept and acknowledge the impairment [43]. This was the case with the non-wearers in our current study. The non-wearers’ wish for inclusion in society was based on being valued and accepted as they were. This might well mean that the psychosocial contribution of the prosthesis in combating others’ staring at them is unnecessary after all. By not wearing an unnatural-looking prosthesis, children and adolescents believed they were not altering their appearance. This helped them reinforce their self-esteem and improve their self-identity. In addition, if prostheses are seen as having no functional gain [8], [13], [46], as being technically unsatisfactory and physically uncomfortable [47]–[49], and sometimes actually hampering effective performance [8] – issues we also found in the present research – the added value of the prosthesis disappears and rejection of it occurs. Interestingly, some of the participants succeeded in embracing acceptance and in using the prosthesis for some daily-life activities and in playing sports, a phenomenon also described in the literature [7], [12]. These observations question prosthetic functionality and necessity: “Are prostheses the best solution for children’s and adolescent’s needs?” Our study also highlighted the perceived value children and adolescents expressed regarding the use of adaptive devices. These devices are light-weight, designed for specific activities, easy to manipulate and to put on [50]. Therefore, considering adaptive devices as an option for rehabilitating children and adolescents with UCBED may be of great value.Study participants, whether wearers or non-wearers, seemed to have the same expectations from a prosthesis when they decided to choose for one (i.e., nicer appearance and better functionality). After wearing and testing it, these expectations were not met for non-wearers, and only partially met for wearers. This discrepancy between a person’s wishes and the outcomes of prosthetic use, detected by healthcare professionals in the present study, has also been reported in the literature by parents of these children [13] and by adults [51]. Providing information and clarifying the real possibilities and limitations of prosthetic use for consumers would serve to balance expectations versus real-life possibilities. More opportunities for trying and using prostheses before purchasing them would allow children and early and late adolescents to make a more informed choice. Providing these opportunities could be organized in the form of banks with prosthetic simulators that could be rented. A prosthetic simulator is a prosthesis which is adapted with fastening systems and can be attached on any type of arm (amputated, normal) [52].The current research results were in line with the findings of other studies that stated that peer-to-peer contact provided emotional assistance for parents and children, as well as understanding, interaction, and identification with people in the same situation [9], [40], [53]. Incorporating regular peer-to-peer meetings into healthcare would address important aspects of the harmonious development of children and early and late adolescents with UCBED.Patient-centered care was supported by healthcare professionals in our study. Patient-centered care considers three assumptions that would improve rehabilitation care: the patient (1) is the customer, (2) is the “owner of his body, mind, and soul,” and (3) has requested a service in a health matter, so the service provided should focus on the patient’s desires [54].A subject of novelty in the literature and a strength of this study is the fact that children, early adolescents and late adolescents themselves were interviewed, and not only people in the immediate environment (e.g., parents), as in the majority of studies. Along with reasons for rejection – preferentially treated in the literature – the current study also explored the determinants for wearing prostheses in children and early and late adolescents with UCBED. Their opinions about prosthetic use and rehabilitation care allowed for a better understanding of the needs that a young person with UCBED experiences at a certain stage of life. The use of online focus group interviews proved to be an efficient method for collecting a large amount of data in a short period of time. For youngsters with UCBED, the online interaction was easy-going and convenient, since it offered anonymity and flexible participation hours [24], [25], [29].This study also has some limitations. Opinions about prosthetic wear in the children and parents groups may have been underexplored due to the low number of wearers in these two groups. However, in all groups, the majority of the current non-wearers had previously worn prostheses. As such, opinions of non-wearers were also valuable for determining reasons for wearing prostheses. There were more females than males in the early adolescent, late adolescent, and parent groups. They might have influenced the results by highlighting the importance of cosmesis, but studies with a majority of males found the cosmetic aspect very important as well [35], [51], [55]. One may argue that the age of fitting the first prosthesis varies between the groups and might have had an influence on reporting reasons for prosthetic use. No clear proof exists in the literature regarding possible relationships between age of fitting and prosthetic use in later life [15], [16].The findings of this study should be interpreted in the context of qualitative studies and focus groups. Future studies in larger populations, designed as interviews or questionnaires, might explore in detail the reasons why children and early and late adolescents with UCBED either wear prostheses or do not do so.Children and early and late adolescents with UCBED seem to choose and wear prostheses mainly for cosmetic reasons, in order to achieve social integration and not because of limited functionality. Peer-to-peer contact, organized by the rehabilitation teams in conjunction with other institutions, appeared to be an important informational and emotional support for children, early adolescents, and parents. When working with UCBED youngsters there should also be a focus on the importance of the cosmetic possibilities offered by a prosthesis. Extending the treatment options beyond prostheses to other solutions – such as, for example, the use of adaptive devices – would ease some daily-life activities for these children and adolescents. Further research should also focus on the psychosocial events and experiences in this young group."

            "abstract": [
                "Background: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) represent a particularly attractive cell type for bone tissue engineering because of their ex vivo expansion potential and multipotent differentiation capacity. MSC are readily differentiated towards mature osteoblasts with well-established protocols. However, tissue engineering frequently involves three-dimensional scaffolds which (i) allow for cell adhesion in a spatial environment and (ii) meet application-specific criteria, such as stiffness, degradability and biocompatibility. Methodology/Principal Findings: In the present study, we analysed two synthetic, long-term degradable polymers for their impact on MSC-based bone tissue engineering: PLLA-co-TMC (Resomer® LT706) and poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL). Both polymers enhance the osteogenic differentiation compared to tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) as determined by Alizarin red stainings, scanning electron microscopy, PCR and whole genome expression analysis. Resomer® LT706 and PCL differ in their influence on gene expression, with Resomer® LT706 being more potent in supporting osteogenic differentiation of MSC. The major trigger on the osteogenic fate, however, is from osteogenic induction medium. Conclusion: This study demonstrates an enhanced osteogenic differentiation of MSC on Resomer® LT706 and PCL compared to TCPS. MSC cultured on Resomer® LT706 showed higher numbers of genes involved in skeletal development and bone formation. This identifies Resomer® LT706 as particularly attractive scaffold material for bone tissue engineering. "

            "fulltext": "IntroductionHuman multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are multipotent stem cells and represent a particularly attractive source for tissue engineering, because they are readily isolated and expanded and can differentiate into several mature cell types, such as adipocytes, chondrocytes, osteoblasts and myocytes [1], [2 and references therein]. Due to their mesenchymal origin and their osteogenic differentiation capacity, MSC are particularly promising cells for bone replacement. Using a specific culture medium, they can differentiate towards osteoblasts in vitro within three weeks [3]. However, a biomaterial scaffold is required for bone tissue engineering (BTE) to allow for immobilisation of cells in a spatial structure. A variety of potential biomaterials exist, which are cytocompatible for MSC, e. g. collagen, fibrin and non-oxide ceramics [4]–[8]. For scaffolds in general, cyto- and biocompatibility are the criteria of upmost importance and they need to meet further specific application-dependant criteria. For BTE, a scaffold should be osteoinductive or at least osteoconductive and has to be long-term degradable to allow for an autologous replacement of the transplanted area. Besides such specific requirements, a fundamental bottleneck must be overcome to use MSC for BTE – the adequate supply of the cells. This problem will become more critical when aiming at engineering of bulk tissue to fill bone defects after injury or elimination of tumors, particularly when autologous bone production is desired. Such goals necessitate the maintainance of large numbers of undifferentiated cells embedded in biocompatible matrices to provide sufficient starting material.\nA number of commercially available cell culture materials is accessible, such as standard tissue culture poly(styrene) (TCPS), Primaria™, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and TC plastics biocoated with Matrigel™ or single extracellular matrix proteins, but given properties of the polymers make them ineligible for tissue engineering. Further, frequently the animal origin of biocoating products disqualify them from use in human clinical applications. Currently, the published literature contains a large number of studies in which stem cells are seeded on one or more readily available materials but frequently such studies lack systematic approaches to determine cell responses.\nIn our recent work we established a biomaterial test platform to assess the compatibility of stem cells and biomaterials for tissue engineering in a highly standardised and systematic manner. The assessment of stem cell/biomaterial interactions is multifactorial and requires a stringent analysis of parameters, such as material surface and bulk properties, cytotoxicity, cell adhesion, cell morphology, viability, proliferation, necrosis and apoptosis [5]. In our present study, we analysed in more detail the interactions of MSC with two commercially available synthetic and resorbable polymers of our panel of biomaterials, Poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and poly[(L,L-lactide-co-trimethylene carbonate)7/3] ( = PLLA-co-TMC = Resomer® LT706).\nPCL is a linear, semicrystalline, synthetic aliphatic homopolyester, which has a degradation time of two to three years [9]–[11]. PCL is the most studied degradable polymer of the polyester family [12] and is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration for diverse applications in the human body. Furthermore, PCL is currently under consideration for use in bone tissue engineering [13]–[16].\nIn contrast, there is only poor knowledge on Resomer® LT706. This linear and semi-crystalline poly-lactide-based polymer is similar in chemistry to Suprathel, which is now used in clinical trials for skin replacement after burns [17], [18]. Further, poly(1,3-trimethylene carbonate) copolymerised with D,L-lactide was shown to be long-term biodegradable and biocompatible for soft tissue engineering [19], but so far, polymers related to Resomer® LT706 were not analysed with respect to their usefulness for bone replacement. The random copolymer PLLA-co-TMC (Resomer® LT706) is characterised by an intermediate-term degradation, slower than poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), poly(D,L-lactide acid) (PDLLA), and poly(glycolic acid-co-trimethylene carbonate) (PGA-co-TMC), but faster than the long-term degradable PCL [20]–[22]. Although, Resomer® LT706 has some advantages regarding its mechanical properties and processing behavior, it is used only in a few studies as potential scaffold for hard and soft tissue engineering [23], [24].\nIn the present study, we analysed the two polymers in comparison to TCPS for their osteoinductive capacity and thus for their potential use in BTE. Therefore, we seeded MSC on PCL and Resomer® LT706 samples with defined, ultraflat topography to exclude topography-dependant changes in cell adhesion, morphology and proliferation. MSC adhered on both polymers and showed only minor differences in morphology and viability. When subjected to osteogenic induction medium (OIM), MSC differentiated towards the osteoblastic fate. Alizarin red stainings, realtime PCR, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis revealed a similar frequency of MSC-derived osteoblasts on the two polymers. However, detailed studies on the molecular level including whole genome expression analysis unravelled differences in the biomaterial-based propensity towards the osteogenic fate of MSC supported by these two polymers.\nMethods\nPolymer synthesis\nThe polymers were produced as previously described [5] (Neuss et al., 2008a).\n\n\nPoly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL)\nPCL with a molecular weight of 80.000 g/mol was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich GmbH (Germany). For PCL foils, 3 g of granules were used. These granules were placed on Teflon®-covered metal plates, the temperature was raised to 85°C and maintained for 5 min. A load of 1000 kg was applied for 1 min at 85°C. After cooling down to room temperature, foils were then washed several times with isopropanol (Fluka, Germany), aqueous 0.02 mM Tween 80 (Roth, Germany) and 8 M urea (Roth, Germany) and then rinsed vigorously with demineralised water. PCL samples were then dried in a vacuum oven for 24 h at 40°C. Samples were placed in TCPS wells, stored at 4°C, and protected from light. All steps were carried out under sterile conditions.\n\n\nResomer® LT706\nResomer type poly(L-lactic acid-co-trimethylene carbonate) ( = P(LLA-co-TMC; lactic acid-trimethylene carbonate ratio 70:30, LT706, 1.2–1.6 dL/g) was purchased from Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co. KG (Germany). Foils were prepared by melt-pressing technique. Therefore, granules were ground to powder in a cryo-mill and 1.2 g of the powder were placed between Teflon®-covered metal plates. This was followed by a 5 min incubation at 180°C. A load of 1000 kg was applied for 9 min. The P(LLA-co-TMC) foil was allowed to cool down to room temperature, removed from the metal plates and further processed as for as for PCL.\n\n\nCoating of biomaterials with radiolabeled fibronectin and vitronectin\n100 µl of either fibronectin or vitronectin (100 µg diluted in 100 µl PBS; BD, Heidelberg, Germany) were mixed in a silanised counter vial (3.5 ml volume) with 1 µl Na125I solution (0.1 mCi; 3.7 MBq; 45 pmol; Amersham Europe, Freiburg, Germany) and 5 µl Chloramine-T solution (10 µg Chloramine-T trihydrate, solved in 100 µl PBS) using a magnetic stir bar. After 5 min, the incorporation of 125I into fibronectin and vitronectin was measured by TCA precipitation. Therefore, a melted glass capillary was immerged first into the iodinising mixture and then into 200 µl of BSA solution (10% (m/m) BSA, 1% (m/m) NaI, 0.01% (m/m) NaN3). After vigorously mixing of the solution, an aliquot of 10 µl was admixed with another 200 µl BSA solution. Afterwards, 2 ml ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid was added. The precipitated material consisting of BSA and target protein was spinned down, separated from the supernatant and measured using a gamma counter COBRA II Auto-Gamma (Packard, Dreieich, Germany). To separate labelled protein from non-incorporated iodine, the mixture was purified by gel filtration using a Sephadex® G-25 NAP™5 Column (Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The column was equilibrated with PBS before use. The identified radiolabelled proteins were stored at −20°C. Radiolabeled fibronectin and vitronectin were dissolved in PBS and DMEM with 10% FCS in a concentration of 10 µg/ml.\nRadiolabeled protein adsorption study was carried out by incubation of TCPS, Resomer® LT706 and PCL disc surfaces with 2 ml of the different solutions, each with 125I-labeled fibronectin or vitronectin (10 µg/ml), respectively. The activity was adjusted to 100.000 cpm/500 µl (1.67 kBq/500 µl; 45.0 pCi/500 µl) using a tracer. To test the resulting activity, samples of 500 µl volume were measured using the gamma counter COBRA II Auto-Gamma during a period of 3 min. After treatment of biomaterial substrates with radiolabelled protein (incubation time 1 h) and subsequent washing, activity was measured using the gamma counter during a period of 5 min.\nSignificant differences between samples were analysed using student's t-test for 10 independent measurements of each coating.\n\n\nIsolation of human mesenchymal stem cells\nHuman mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were isolated from femoral head spongiosa of patients with total hip joint endoprosthesis (TEP) after written consent was obtained from the patients. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Clinics, Aachen, Germany. MSC were characterised as previously described [5]–[8], [25]; Fig. S2. In brief, after rinsing the spongiosa with stem cell medium, spongiosa was removed and the remaining cell suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 500×g. Thereafter, the cell pellet was resuspended in stem cell medium and cells were seeded in a T75 culture flask and cultured at 37°C in a 21% O2 and 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. After 24 hours, non adherent (hematopoietic) cells were removed by medium change. Mesenchymal stem cells were expanded in growth medium (PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) consisting of 60% DMEM low glucose, 40% MCDB-201, 2% FCS, 1×ITS-plus (insulin-transferrin-selenic acid+BSA-linoleic acid), 1 nM dexamethasone, 100 µM ascorbic-acid-2-phosphate, and 10 ng/ml EGF. Medium was replenished every 3–4 days. At 80–90% confluency, stem cells were trypsinised with stem cell trypsin (CellSystems, St. Katharinen, Germany) and reseeded in a density of 5,000 cells/cm2 for optimal proliferation.\n\n\nDifferentiation of MSC towards osteoblasts\nFor osteogenic differentiation, MSC were seeded in a density of 3.1×104 cells/cm2 on TCPS and on foils of the two polymers PCL and Resomer® LT706. Twenty-four hours after seeding, the growth medium was replaced with osteogenic induction medium (OIM) consisting of DMEM low glucose (PAA, Coelbe, Germany), 100 nM dexamethasone, 10 mM sodium β-glycerophosphate, 0.05 mM L-ascorbic-acid-2-phosphate (all Sigma, Steinheim, Germany) and 10% FCS (PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany). Medium was changed every 2–3 days. After 21 days of osteogenic differentiation, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol for 1 hour, washed three times with demineralised water and then stained with an Alizarin red solution (40 mM, pH 4.1, Sigma) for 10 minutes. Finally, cells were washed three times with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline).\nFor quantification, the Alizarin red precipitates were solubilised. Briefly, stained samples were incubated with 800 µl acetic acid (10%) for 30 min. Then, supernatant was transferred into a 1.5 ml tube and boiled for 10 min at 85°C, followed by a 5 min incubation on ice. After centrifugation (15 min, 15,000×g), 500 µl of the supernatant were transferred into another 1.5 ml tube and mixed with 200 µl of 10% ammonium hydroxide. Samples of 150 µl were transferred into a 96 well microtiter plate and optical density was measured at 405 nm using a standard ELISA reader.\nP-value to detect statistically relevant differences for the different biomaterials was calculated with student's t-test (n = 3 with two replicates each).\n\n\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM)\nMSC/polymer biohybrids were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde for at least 24 hours, rinsed with sodium phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 7.39, MERCK, Darmstadt, Germany) and dehydrated by incubating consecutively in 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% acetone and then three times in 100% acetone for 10 minutes. The biohybrids were critical-point-dried in liquid CO2, and then sputter-coated with a 30 nm gold layer. Samples were analysed using an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM XL 30 FEG, FEI, PHILIPS, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) in a high vacuum environment.\n\n\nEnergy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy\nEnergy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) is an analytical technique used for element analysis samples. EDS was performed on the XL 30 FEG scanning electron microscope (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) using an EDAX Falcon Genesis Spectrum 5.21 energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy system with an ultrathin window liquid nitrogen cooled Si(Li) X-ray detector (EDAX Inc. Mahwah, NJ, USA). For the EDS an accelerating voltage of 20 kV was used.\n\n\nReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)\nTotal RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini Kit according to the manufacturers' instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Reverse transcription was done with 1 µg of total RNA using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). PCR was as follows: denaturation at 95°C for 1 min, annealing at 58°C (osteocalcin), 60°C (alkaline phosphatase) for 1 min, extension at 72°C for 1 min (30 cycles), and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were analysed by electrophoresis using a 2% agarose gel and visualised with ethidium bromide. Primer sequences were used as listed in Table 1.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 1.  Primer sequences for PCR and RT-qPCR.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0023195.t001\n\nRealTime PCR (RT-qPCR)\nRealTime PCR was performed using SybrGreen and Taqman technology. Briefly, 10 µl SybrGreen Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) was mixed with 1 µl (10 pg) Primer forward, 1 µl (10 pg) Primer reverse, 6.8 µl water and 1.2 µl (60 ng) template. Then the samples were subjected to the following program: initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 sec and annealing/extension at 60°C for 1 min. Primer sequences and sizes of amplicons are listed in table 1.\n\n\nWhole Genome Expression Analysis\nFor whole genome expression analysis, MSC were seeded in a density of 3.1×104 cells/cm2 on TCPS, Resomer® LT706 and PCL and cultured for 21 days in growth medium (GM) or in osteogenic induction medium (OIM). Cells at day 0 served as control. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy micro Kit according to the manufacturers' instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The RNA quality was assessed using RNA 6000 NanoChips with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent; Santa Clara, CA, USA). Probes for the GeneChip® Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were prepared and hybridised to the arrays according to the Affymetrix GeneChip® Whole Transcript (WT) Sense Target labeling Assay Manual. Briefly, for each sample, 300 ng of total RNA was reverse trancribed into cDNA using a random hexamer oligonucleotide tagged with a T7 promoter sequence (5′-GAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGNNNNNN-3′). After second strand synthesis, double-stranded cDNA was used as template for amplification with T7 RNA polymerase to obtain antisense cRNA. Random hexamers were then used to reverse transcribe the cRNA into single stranded sense strand cDNA. The cDNA was then fragmented by UDG (uracil DNA glycosylase) and APE1 (apurinic/apyrimidic endonuclease 1). Fragment size was checked using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (fragment size between 50–200 bp). Fragmented sense cDNA was biotin-labelled with TdT (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase) and probes were hybridised to the GeneChip® Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays at 45°C for 16 hours. Hybridised arrays were then washed and stained on Fluidics Station 450 and scanned on a GeneChip® Scanner 3000 7G (both Affymetrix).\nThe image data were analysed with GCOS (Affymetrix). For statistical analysis data were processed by R software (R Development Core Team, 2005). Gene expression levels were normalised with RMA algorithm [26]. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering were done on whole genome transcripts by the R Stats Package [27]. Hierarchical clustering was performed using Pearson correlation coefficient and the Average linkage method. RankProd, a non-parametric statistic, was employed for identification of differentially expressed genes [28]. Transcripts with a fold change more than 2 and P-value less than 0.01 between two conditions were considered as being differentially expressed. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway over-representation analysis was done using DAVID bioinformatics resources [29].\n\nResults\nResomer® LT706 and PCL enhance MSC differentiation towards osteoblasts\nIn a previous study, we analysed MSC on a grid-based platform in contact to different polymers to determine cytocompatibility of polymers for future MSC-based tissue engineering applications [5]. Now, MSC were cultured for 21 days either in growth medium (GM) or in osteogenic induction medium (OIM) on two of the cytocompatible, synthetic, biodegradable polymers, Resomer® LT706 and PCL, which are potentially osteoinductive. To analyse the osteogenic differentiation, calcium accumulations were visualised by Alizarin red staining (Fig. 1A), followed by dissolving the dye and subsequent quantification of the staining (Fig. 1B). Alizarin red stain residues were not retained by any of the biomaterials (Fig. S3). As shown in Figure 1, polymers did not induce osteogenic differentiation by themselve in GM and OIM was always required to guide MSC into osteogenic fate. However, although OIM was required to initiate osteogenic differentiation of MSC on the two polymers, biomaterial properties influenced calcium accumulations.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.

White boxes in 20.000× magnification images represent the area, which was subjected to EDS analysis (D); D) EDS Analysis of surfaces of Resomer® LT706 and PCL after a 21 day cultivation period with MSC either in GM or in OIM. Prominent peaks of calcium and phosphate were detected in samples cultured in OIM, but not in samples cultured in GM (compare y-axis scale).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0023195.g001As shown in Figure 1, both polymers resulted in a stronger alizarin red staining than TCPS. Further, the amount of calcium accumulations on Resomer® LT706 was significantly higher, than on TCPS and on PCL. Since the Alizarin red staining is an indirect measure for osteogenic differentiation, we analysed the differentiation in more detail. The ultrastructural analysis depicted in Figure 1C illustrates the morphology of MSC on the two polymers after a three-week culture period in GM or in OIM (Fig. 1C). Our results show that although MSC morphology on the two polymers differed during initial adhesion [5], MSC morphology is identical on both polymers after 21 days of culture and independent of the culture medium (GM vs. OIM). Higher magnifications showed analogous particles densely covering the biomaterial surfaces under differentiation conditions (OIM) on both polymers, which were qualitatively identified as consisting of calcium and phospate by EDS analysis (Fig. 1D). Such calciumphosphate particles are indicative for an advanced osteogenic differentiation of MSC on both polymers, Resomer® LT706 and PCL. These results were confirmed by the expression of osteogenic markers, such as alkaline phosphatase (which is already expressed in unstimulated MSC), osteocalcin, bone sialoprotein and the transcription factor Cbfa-1 after 21 days of cultivation in OIM on the polymers (Fig. 2). By demonstrating (i) positive Alizarin red staining and (ii) expression of standard osteogenic markers on the RNA level, well-accepted standard assays were performed to show osteogenic differentiation of MSC on Resomer® LT706 and PCL. However, we reasoned that conventional standard assays are not sufficient to comprehensively investigate the osteogenic fate of MSC and thus we postulated, that there might be differences in the quality of the MSC-derived osteoblasts on the molecular level. Therefore, we performed whole genome expression analysis to determine biomaterial-related differences in osteogenic differentiation.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 2.

First, data were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA, Fig. 3A) to discriminate related samples (similar gene expression) from distant samples (different gene expression). Figure 3A reveals the following information: the closer the samples are, the more related is the gene expression pattern. Thus, PCA demonstrated (i) general changes in gene expression during the 21 day culture period (compare day 0 samples D1–3 cultured in GM, with all other samples), (ii) donor variations, since donor 3 is separated from donors 1 and 2 after 21 days of culture, but (iii) the same shift of all three donors occurred from culture in GM and to culture in OIM (arrow in Fig. 3A). Hierarchical clustering (Fig. 3B) of the same data set also revealed general changes in gene expression over time (samples D1–3, grey dottet line), donor variations as well as the shift between growth and differentiation conditions (blue dottet lines vs. red dottet lines, respectively). Additionally, this analysis also identified clustering of Resomer® LT706 with TCPS, independent of donor and independent of growth (GM) and differentiation (OIM) conditions (Fig. 3B). Thus for each donor, Resomer® LT706 and TCPS consistently clustered together when cultured in GM or in OIM (e.g. L3 OIM/T3 OIM or L2 GM/T2 GM). In most cases, these neighboring clusters were adjacent to the corresponding donor in the respective medium on PCL (e.g. P3 GM is next to the L3 GM/T3 GM pair). Although the Alizarin red staining was much stronger on Resomer® LT706 than on TCPS (Fig. 1A, B), the impact of Resomer® LT706 on MSC gene expression seemed to be comparable to TCPS, both after culture in GM and OIM. In contrast, PCL resulted in a different gene expression profile compared to Resomer® LT706 and TCPS, but in most cases, PCL samples were in direct proximity to TCPS and Resomer® LT706 in the respective culture conditions (blue and red dottet lines; Fig. 3B).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 3.

Orange circles = MSC cultured for 21 days in GM; green circles = MSC cultured for 21 days in OIM; blue circles = MSC expanded on TCPS in GM before differentiation experiment; T = TCPS; L = Resomer® LT706; P = PCL; D = Donor at day 0; 1,2,3 = different donors (n = 3); PC1, 2, 3 = Principal Component 1, 2 and 3; B) The dendrogram shows clustering of TCPS and Resomer® LT706, independent of donor and independent of growth (GM) and differentiation (OIM) conditions. T = TCPS; L = Resomer® LT706; P = PCL; D = Donor at day 0; 1,2,3 = different donors (n = 3); red dotted lines = OIM; blue dotted lines = GM.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0023195.g003The results shown in Figure 3 indicate donor variations, as expected for primary cells, but a similar influence on gene expression by TCPS and Resomer® LT706, which was independent of culture medium. Hence, we show that culture medium has a stronger influence on MSC differentiation than the biomaterial substrates. Alizarin red staining was stronger for PCL and Resomer® LT706 compared to TCPS (Fig. 1A, B), yet PCL affected more genes within the same culture conditions than Resomer® LT706 when compared to cells on TCPS. This analysis describes the overall impact on the gene expression profile and the identity of differentially expressed genes is discussed below.\n\n\nBiomaterial substrate and culture medium impact on gene expression of MSC and MSC-derived osteoblasts\nResomer® LT706, PCL and TCPS are semi-crystalline polymers with a characteristic, textured structure and ultraflat topography. Thus, the biomaterial surface physicochemistry could be responsible for the specific changes in gene expression rather than the biomaterial topography. Depending on the surface physicochemistry, proteins adsorb to the biomaterial, yet the underlaying mechanisms are still not fully understood. In this context we emphasize that cells do not adhere directly to biomaterial surfaces but rather adhere to a protein layer, which promptly adsorbes to biomaterials, when exposed to cell culture medium. Within the two cell culture media (GM and OIM) the composition of proteins is quite different, which presumably results in different protein layers on the biomaterial surfaces when cultured either in GM or in OIM (2% FCS vs. 10% FCS, respectively). Further, the amount of adsorbed proteins and the orientation of active groups of the adsorbed proteins could differ depending on the biomaterial physicochemistry. Accordingly, this leads to different cell behaviours on the very same biomaterial, when cultured in different media. However, within the same culture medium, different biomaterials can influence cells in different ways.\nThe heatmap of expression data shown in Figure 4A demonstates the impact of biomaterial substrate and culture medium on gene expression of MSC and MSC-derived osteoblasts. We detect two main gene expression pattern: one is representative for cells cultured in GM (Fig. 4A, right) and one for cells cultured in OIM (Fig. 4A, left), regardless of the biomaterial substrate meaning that the impact of the growth medium is higher than the impact of the biomaterials. However, within the two groups, MSC cultured on Resomer® LT706 and TCPS cluster together, while PCL form a separate branch, which is in line with the results depicted in Figure 3. Again, these results demonstrate the influence of culture medium on MSC, which is more prominent than the influence of biomaterial substrates.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 4.

Genes boxed by a discontinuous line are similarly expressed in TCPS and Resomer® LT706 (upper box) or in Resomer® LT706 and PCL (lower box). Genes highlighted in orange were analysed by RT-qPCR. T = TCPS; L = Resomer® LT706; P = PCL; 1,2,3 = different donors; C) RT-qPCR for SFRP4, PRELP, COMP, COL11A1, ELN and CCL2 to confirm gene array results of Figure 4C. Expression of genes was normalised to the reference gene ß-actin. TCPS was used as calibrator. n = 3.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0023195.g004As shown by hierarchical clustering (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4A), MSC on Resomer® LT706 and TCPS show a similar gene expression pattern and this translates into a small number of differentially expressed genes. As described above, MSC do not attach directly to the biomaterial surface, but to the protein layer, which covers the biomaterials after exposure to the cell culture medium. As shown in Figure S1, fibronectin (FN) and vitronectin (VN), two main components of serum involved in cell adhesion, are adsorbed to TCPS, Resomer® LT706 and PCL. While the amount of adsorbed FN is very similar for TCPS and PCL (approx. 120 ng/cm2), Resomer® LT706 is covered with approx. 150 ng FN/cm2. However, the relation between absorbed FN and VN is the same for TCPS and Resomer® LT706 (fibronectin to vitronectin ratio = 1.2), while the relation between FN and VN on PCL is 1.04. These results were not significantly different either when we used a buffer system including FN and VN or serum-containing medium including FN and VN (not shown). Thus, the ratio of adsorbed FN to adsorbed VN might be key to MSC gene expression.\nFinally, differentially regulated genes of MSC cultured on Resomer® LT706, PCl and TCPS under differentiation conditions (OIM) were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis and data depicted in heat map format (Fig. 4B). This analysis shows that Resomer® LT706 and TCPS clustered together and PCL formed a distinct cluster. Some donor variations were also seen in this heat map representation, which is in line with the PCA analysis (Fig. 3A). In addition, this analysis identified a large cluster of genes, with a similar expression pattern in Resomer® LT706 and TCPS (Fig. 4B, upper boxed area). Furthermore, we also identified genes that showed a similar expression in MSC on Resomer® LT706 and PCL, but are differentially expressed in MSC on TCPS, e.g. CCL2 (Fig. 4B, bottom boxed area).\nWell-known osteogenic marker genes were expressed in MSC cultured on all three biomaterials (TCPS, Resomer® LT706 and PCL; compare Fig. 2). Thus, the expression and interaction of other genes involved in osteogenesis and chondrogenesis (Fig. 4C) might be important to regulate MSC differentiation towards osteoblasts either via osteogenesis or ossification on these biomaterials. To further support the data of whole genome gene expression analysis, we perfomed quantitative PCR. Therefore, we choosed a panel of genes involved in skeletal development and osteogenic differentiation, highlighted in orange in Figure 4B. As shown in Figure 4C, gene expression of MSC-derived osteoblasts was influenced by biomaterial substrates or – by keeping in mind the results on FN and VN described above - by serum proteins which are adsorbed to the biomaterials before cell attachment.\nSecreted frizzled related protein 4 (SFRP4), Proline/arginine-rich end leucine-rich repeat protein (PRELP), cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), α1 XI collagen (COL11A1) and elastin (ELN) expression is higher in MSC cultured in OIM on Resomer® LT706 and TCPS in comparison to PCL (Fig. 4C). Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) expression is increased under differentiation conditions on Resomer® LT706 and PCL (compare Fig. 4C with Fig. 4B).\n\n\nGene ontology (GO) overrepresentation analysis detects biological categories related to skeletal development and bone formation\nGene functions are described in a controlled vocabulary format referred to as gene ontology (GO; www.geneontology.org) and thus differentially regulated genes between the three biomaterials cultured in GM and OIM were subjected to GO overrepresentation analysis, respectively. The main categories of the two culture conditions are shown for MSC cultured on Resomer® LT706, PCL and TCPS in GM (Table 2) and for MSC cultured on Resomer® LT706, PCL and TCPS in OIM (Table S2). Some categories exist in both lists, like developmental process, system development and extracellular region. However, bone specific categories, such as bone remodelling, calcium ion binding, bone mineralisation, ossification and biomineral formation are – as expected - not found in the GO list for the growth conditions (GM), but confined to the GO list for the differentiation conditions (OIM).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 2.  GO list with genes differentially expressed in MSC cultured on TCPS, Resomer® LT706 and PCL during growth conditions. (GM)doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0023195.t002\nMSC are the natural precursor cells of mesenchymal tissue, such as fat, bone and cartilage. They reside in a tissue-specific niche, awaiting signals for tissue regeneration, if necessary [30]. In the last decade, MSC were extensively investigated for their usefulness in bone tissue engineering and diverse scaffold materials were suggested to provide an appropriate three-dimensional environment [31]–[34]. Promising tissue-engineered constructs are already on the way from bench to bedside [35]. However, the impact of scaffolds on osteogenic differentiation on the molecular level was rarely analysed and restricted to some well-known osteogenic marker genes, such as alkaline phosphatase, runt related transcription factor 2, type 1 collagen, bone sialoprotein and osteocalcin [34], [36].In the present study, we initially investigated a panel of different polymers for their influence on the osteogenic differentiation of MSC. We then focused on the two most prominent synthetic polymers Resomer® LT706 and PCL. Both polymers are linear, semi-crystalline polyesters, which are hydrolytically or enzymatically degradable. Resomer® LT706 is degradable within 8–12 month, while PCL is long-term degradable (>24 month) [20].PCL is an FDA proved and widely used engineering polymer with excellent physical, chemical and mechanical properties [37], [38]. It is already analysed in the context of bone tissue engineering, either as pure PCL [39], as composite scaffold e.g. together with hydroxyapatite or calcium phosphate [40], [41] or modified with a peptide layer such as RGD [16]. All of these studies suggest PCL as suitable scaffold material for bone tissue engineering.In contrast, Resomer® LT706 is a relatively novel and less-investigated synthetic polymer, described for the first time as Poly(L-lactide-co-TMC) in 2005 by Pospiech and coworkers [42]. Materials with related chemistry are shown to be biodegradable and biocompatible for soft tissue engineering [19] and used in clinical trials for skin replacements [17], [18]. However, our recent work showed that a prediction of cell behaviour on a chemically related material is not possible [5]. Resomer® LT706 was not analysed in the context of bone tissue engineering or osteogenic differentiation of MSC so far.We compared the osteogenic differentiation of MSC on the two elastomeric and long-term degradable synthetic polymers Resomer® LT706 and PCL. TCPS served as control. Our XPS data revealed that the two polyesters Resomer® LT706 and PCL do not differ qualitatively in their elemental composition, but quantitatively, indicated by the C/O ratio. The C/O-values for Resomer® LT706 and PCL are 1.7 and 2.6, respectively (Table S1). Further, XPS analysis of our biomaterial surfaces shows that PCL contains less oxygen atoms than Resomer® LT706, indicating PCL as more hydrophobic than Resomer® LT706. However, contact angle measurements detected the opposite, with Resomer® LT706 being more hydrophobic than PCL with the corresponding contact angles of 75° and 69°, respectively. The higher hydrophobic characteristic of Resomer® LT706 is a result of its molecular structure. Resomer® LT706 consists of 68–72% L-lactide units and thus includes sterically demanding and hydrophobic methyl groups in high frequencies at the surface. In contrast, PCL only includes methylene groups in its backbone. TCPS – in contrast to polystyrol – does not consist of phenyl rings, but also includes surface modifications (established by physical plasma) of hydroxyl-, carboxyl- and amino-groups on the surface and a contact angle of only 54° (Table S1).To allow for an adequate adhesion of MSC on our substrates (TCPS, Resomer® LT706, PCL and TCPS), an initial adsorption of cell adhesion mediators from culture medium, such as fibronectin (FN) and vitronectin (VN), is crucial, since in general, the less adsorbed proteins the less cell adhesion is mediated. As shown in our adsorption studies with radiolabelled FN and VN (Figure S1), Resomer® LT706 is covered with the highest amount of FN proteins, compared to TCPS and PCL. Further, the ratio of FN to VN on Resomer® LT706 is comparable to that on TCPS, albeit absolut values are higher for Resomer® LT706. It is known that extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins are involved in cell adhesion not only by their own presence, but also by their relation to other ECM proteins [43], [44]. This ratio of different ECM proteins then can result in differences in cell adhesion, morphology, proliferation, gene expression as well as ECM secretion. The similar ratio of FN/VN on Resomer® LT706 and TCPS compared to PCL (1.2 and 1.04, respectively) might be the reason for a comparable initial adhesion and morphology of MSC, which differs from that on PCL, where the cells are more roundish after 24 h of incubation [5]. However, MSC proliferation within 7 days after cell seeding was comparable for TCPS, Resomer® LT706 and PCL [5] and cell morphology was identical after 21 days of culture in GM or OIM (Fig. 1C). Although we detected a comparable proliferation of MSC on all three substrates, osteogenic differentiation capacity was different.In the present study, we found that both Resomer® LT706 and PCL cyused stronger alizarin red stainings compared to TCPS, which however was most significant for Resomer® LT706. The fact that the alizarin red staining is stronger for Resomer® LT706 than for PCL, though MSC proliferation is comparable on both polymers [5], suggests that Resomer® LT706 is more potent in supporting osteogenic differentiation than PCL. A positive Alizarin red staining is indicative for osteogenic MSC fate, but stains only calcium accumulations and thus provides only indirect evidence. We were thus interested in the quality and the molecular mechanisms underlying osteogenic differentiation of MSC on Resomer® LT706 and PCL. As initial step in this direction we performed whole genome expression analysis using Affymetrix gene arrays. Bioinformatic tools then unravelled (i) donor variations as expected for primary cells, (ii) clusters of samples representative for MSC cultured in growth medium (GM) or in osteogenic induction medium (OIM), indicating a stronger influence of culture medium than of biomaterial substrates, and (iii) clusters of TCPS and Resomer® LT706 under growth (GM) and differentiation conditions (OIM), demonstrating a similar influence on MSC gene expression. Pairs of TCPS and Resomer® LT706 were detected in all bioinformatic analysis. Although both materials are quite different e.g. in surface chemistry (polarity, hydrophobicity, surface charge) and bulk properties (e.g. stiffness), the impact on gene expression related to osteogenesis of MSC is comparable. Yet, TCPS is not useful for bone tissue engineering because of its fabrication characteristics based on its chemical and physical properties. Again this supports our recent study, showing that related biomaterials do not inevitably result in the same cellular response, while unrelated materials might do [5]. The heat map in Figure 4B shows that most genes were expressed on a similar level in MSC cultured on TCPS and Resomer® LT706, while only a few genes were differentially expressed on these two materials.We extended our gene array results by RT-qPCR of the six genes secreted frizzled related protein 4 (SFRP4), Proline/arginine-rich end leucine-rich repeat protein (PRELP), cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), α1 XI collagen (COL11A1), elastin (ELN) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) (Fig. 4C).For all of these genes published data suggest a role in skeletal development or osteogenic differentiation. SFRP4 is expressed in periosteum and bone tissue but overexpression of SFRP4 suppresses osteoblast proliferation [45]. PRELP is a connective tissue matrix protein, which is expressed in cartilage and in osteoblasts [46]. COMP is involved in skeletal development and osteoblast differentiation [47] and detectable in MG-63 cells, an osteoblast cell line. Mutations of COMP are related to specific diseases, such as pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia [48]. COL11A1 is essential for normal skeletal development, but has to be suppressed for terminal osteoblast differentiation [49]. Elastin degradation products promote osteogenic differentiation and elastin-related calcification is suggested to be involved in tissue repair processes [50]. Finally, CCL2 - which is known as chemokine for the recruitment of cells of the immune system, such as monocytes - is secreted by MSC and this secretion increases the differentiation into mature osteoblasts [51].Compared to MSC cultured on TCPS and Resomer® LT706, all genes showed lower expression in MSC cultured on PCL, except CCL2. Since all these genes are involved in skeletal development and bone formation, our results suggest Resomer® LT706 as more suitable for bone tissue engineering than PCL.In summary, we analysed osteogenic differentiation of MSC on Resomer® LT706 and PCL. Alizarin red stainings and expression of conventional osteogenic transcripts show that both biomaterials support osteogenic differentiation fate. However, whole genome expression analysis revealed differences in gene expression and genes involved in skeletal development and bone formation are more expressed at higher levels in MSC cultured on Resomer® LT706. Thus, this novel, long-term degradable and osteoconductive synthetic polymer is suggested as particularly attractive scaffold material for bone tissue engineering with superior properties compared to the currently being used material PCL. The in vitro transformation of MSC on Resomer® LT706 to more osteogenic genotypes might also translate to phenotypes. This hypothesis has to be verified in future in vivo models."

                "Objective: To assess the efficacy of video-assisted minimally invasive surgical vs. catheter ablation for the long-standing persistent AF. Methods: We performed a retrospective comparative analysis in a series of 166 long-standing persistent AF patients treated between 2006 and 2009 with either video-assisted minimally invasive ablation (83 patients), or catheter ablations (83 patients). The catheter group was screened using a ‘pair-matched case-control’ methodology in order to select appropriate statistical comparison candidates out of 169 long-standing persistent AF patients which were potentially suitable for surgery, but have been treated with catheter approaches in order to balance major prognostic factors between the two groups. Follow-up for all patients ranged from 1 to 3.6 years. Results: No patient died postoperatively. One patient suffered from stroke in the surgical group but recovered before discharge. Freedom from AF was obtained in 59.0% and 74.7% during follow-up in the catheter group and the surgical group respectively (P = 0.047). Patients in the catheter group had a significantly higher rate of recurrent arrhythmia (P = 0.011, hazard ratio: 0.555, 95% CI: 0.354 to 0.872) compared with the surgically treated group. The freedom from antiarrhythmic drugs was 44.6% in the catheter group and 61.4% in the surgical group (P = 0.043). Conclusions: The video-assisted minimally invasive ablation was safe and effective, and had an optimistic success rate for patients with long-standing persistent AF in our retrospective comparative study. Thus, further randomized studies addressing this issue seem to be justified. "

            "fulltext": "IntroductionAtrial fibrillation (AF) affects proximately 10 million patients in China, undoubtedly the largest demographic group in the world [1]. Catheter ablation targeting pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) has been evolved over the past decade and has become the common treatment for AF [2], but it often requires repeated procedures, and is associated with serious, although infrequent, complications [3], [4]. It has limited success in persistent and permanent AF, although different ablation strategies beyond PVI have been described to improve the outcome in this patient group [5], [6]. Wolf and colleagues reported encouraging early experiences with a stand-alone, minimally invasive, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical technique for the epicardial ablation of AF on a beating heart with the use of dry radiofrequency (RF) bipolar energy [7].\nTo assess the clinical outcome of surgical ablation we performed a retrospective analysis comparing two pair-matched groups of patients with long-standing persistent AF, one treated with video-assisted minimally invasive ablation, and the other one treated with conventional catheter approach.\nMethods\n2.1 Objective\nIn this restrospective study we compared the surgical minimally invasive surgery method versus the internal medicine catheter ablation method in order to evaluate an optimal proceeding for the treatment of long-standing atrial fibrillation and we hypothesised that minimally invasive surgery is the superior approach.\n\n\n2.2 Patients\nBetween 2006 and 2009, 91 consecutive patients with long-standing persistent AF were treated with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical ablation at the Atrial Fibrillation Centre, Beijing Anzhen Hospital. Long-standing persistent AF was defined as continuous AF lasting longer than 1 year, resistant to either electrical or pharmacological cardioversion. Indications for surgical AF ablation were: Drug-refractory; inability to tolerate antiarrhythmic drugs or anticoagulation therapy as well as left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% or greater. The patients should also have been able to provide a written informed consent, their life expectancy should have been at least 2 years and they must have been able to attend scheduled follow-up visits. The exclusion criteria in the surgical group were: left ventricular ejection fraction lower than 30%, sick sinus syndrome, severe pleural adhesions as well as prior attempts with catheter ablation for a treatment of atrial fibrillation, what means that none of the patients in the surgical group, which we have chosen for the comparison, underwent a previous catheter ablation. In order to assess the role of surgery in the treatment of long-standing persistent AF, treatment outcome in this group of patients was compared with that of patients managed with conventional catheter approaches. The inclusion criteria for a treatment with catheter AF ablation were: Symptomatic AF refractory or intolerance to at least one class 1 or 3 antiarrhythmic medication and patients with heart failure and/or reduced ejection fraction. In addition in rare clinical situations, it may be appropriate to perform catheter AF ablation as the first line therapy. The exclusion criteria in the catheter group were: Left ventricular ejection fraction <30 percent, presence of left atrial thrombus on transesophageal echocardiography and prior attempts with catheter or surgical ablation for an atrial fibrillation treatment.\nTo secure a relatively reliable comparative analysis between patients treated with and without surgery, we performed a matched case-control procedure. From the group of patients treated with catheter approaches we selected cases with similar favorable prognostic factors matching those in the surgical group and from a total of 169 patients treated with catheter approaches, we selected 89 cases which also would have been potentially suitable for surgery. Each patient from the surgical group has then been pair-matched to a patient from the screened catheter group, taking into account the most important prognostic factors, which were duration of AF, left atrial dimension and sex. Patients from both groups for whom no comparable control case could be found were then excluded from further analysis. As a result of this process, 166 patients were selected for a comparative analysis; 83 treated with minimal invasive surgery versus 83 managed with catheter approach (Table 1).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 1.  Patient characteristics.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0022122.t001\n\n2.3 Catheter ablation\nAblation was guided by an electroanatomical mapping system (CARTO, Biosense Webster) and performed with a temperature-controlled, quadripolar, deflectable catheter with a 3.5-mm irrigated-tip catheter (Navistar, Biosense Webster) to encircle the left and right pulmonary vein (PV) 1 to 2 cm from their ostia, with additional lines in the posterior left atrium or roof and along the mitral isthmus. Two decapolar circular mapping catheters (Lasso, Biosense-Webster Inc) were placed inside the ipsilateral superior and inferior PVs or within the superior and inferior branches of a common PV to verify PVI during radiofrequency current ablation. RF current was delivered at each site until the local electrogram amplitude was reduced by at least 80%. Contiguous lesions were delivered at about 20 mm from the PV ostia. Additional ablation within the circles was performed in most of the patients, outside the PVs, where the local electrogram amplitude exceeded 0.2 mV. Additional lines were created in the posterior wall between the 2 encircling PV lesions and from the lower aspect of the left inferior PV to the mitral annulus. If AF was still present at the end of PVI, transthoracic cardioversion was used to restore sinus rhythm (SR). The end point was defined as the absence of any PV spike recorded on the 2 Lasso catheters placed within the ipsilateral PVs after at least 30 minutes following the PV isolation during SR.\n\n\n2.4 Surgical Technique\nThe video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical procedure was developed to perform an electrically PVI bilaterally. In brief a bipolar RF clamp and RF generator system (AtriCure, Inc, Cincinnati, Ohio) is used to achieve linear, transmural ablation lesions. The procedure is conducted after a general anesthesia administered with a double-lumen endotracheal tube and a transesophageal echocardiography used in the operating room is included in order to verify the left atrial appendage (LAA) excisions at the end of the procedures. As shown in Fig. 1 (A–B), each set of PV was encircled and ablated on the left atrium by using an epicardial-placed bipolar RF clamp and no other epicardial lesions were placed. The ligament of Marshall was taken down in all patients and a detailed ganglionic plexus (GP) mapping and ablation was performed. Thoracoscopic LAA exclusion was then performed using a Thoracic Endoscopic Linear Cutter EZ45G (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc, Cincinnati, OH), with non buttressed 4.8-mm staples (Fig.1C). Appropriate stapler angle and adequate appendage coverage was enhanced by direct visualization through the working port.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.

(C) The left atrial appendage is excised by stapling it with a stapler.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0022122.g001\n\n2.5 Intraoperative Electrophysiologic Testing\nIntraoperative electrophysiologic testing was performed, which includes bilateral PV antrum, baseline and post isolation sensing, pacing and GP detection. A baseline positive sensing result (rapid and disorderly atrial potentials) in the PV antrum area could be detected before PVI, and a negative sensing result (no atrial potentials) could be detected in the same area after ablation, which is called entrance block. A positive baseline pacing result is defined as the atrial and ventricular capture, what is the contraction of the atrium and ventricle in response to the electrical stimulus being sent from the temporary pacemaker (Oscor Pace 203H DDD External Dual-Chamber Pacemaker; Oscor Inc, Palm Harbor, Fla). A negative postablation pacing result means that no capture is obtained in the same area after ablation. A combined positive baseline pacing and negative postablation pacing result is called exit block. Achieving both entrance and exit block is regarded as a transmural lesion blocking of the conduction in the PV antrum area. Meanwhile, GP activity detection is included in the electrophysiologic testing procedure, as described by Mehall et al, which consist of a basically mapping by using a high-frequency stimulus (10 V, 800 times per second) for 5 seconds or more [8]. A positive response was defined as sinus bradycardia (<40 beats/min) or asystole, atrioventricular block, or hypotension occurring ventricular asystole of the onset of high-frequency stimulus.\n\n\n2.6 Postablative Medical Management\nPostablative anticoagulation treatment was done according to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology guidelines [9]. The decision whether to apply warfarin or aspirin has been done on the base of the patients Cardiac Failure, Hypertension, Age, Diabetes, Stroke (CHADS) score. Patients received 200 mg of amiodarone orally per day for three months. In the 4th month anticoagulant drug administration was discontinued when SR was present, what was examined by a 24–48 hour Holter monitoring. An AF or atrial flutter (AFL) episode was defined after documentation by means of ECG or Holter monitoring as at least 30 seconds lasting. During the follow-up period, if ECG analysis showed recurrence of AF or AFL which sustained for more than 8 hours and the anticoagulation value was adequately (International normalized ratio >2.0), a direct-current cardioversion was recommended, and a circumferential PV catheter ablation was performed.\n\n\n2.7 Follow-up procedure\nFollow-up controls were obtained from office visits at an outpatient building, mailed medical records received from local hospitals, and questionnaires. As a standard method for monitoring patient' heart rhythm we used a 24 to 48 hour Holter monitoring and additional twelve-lead ECG analysis for AF or AFL recurrence. Transthoracic UCG were evaluated at discharge and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. After one year, patients were seen every 6 months by their referring cardiologist. Free ECG examinations as well as free 24 to 48 hour Holter monitoring (Del Mar Reynolds Medical, Inc, Irvine, Calif) were offered at the Atrial Fibrillation Centre, Beijing Anzhen Hospital.\n\n\n2.8 Ethical approval and consent\nThe protocol was approved by ( Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee of Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University). All participants in this study gave a written informed consent.\n\n\n2.9 Statistical analysis\nContinuous data were presented as the mean ± standard deviation and categorical variables were expressed as the number of cases and percentage. The significance of the differences between the groups was assessed by the Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables. Cumulative event rates were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. All tests were 2-tailed, and p<0.05 was considered significant. The data were analyzed with the SPSS for Windows version 12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\n\nResults\n3.1 Immediate results during hospital observation\nAll patients successfully underwent the ablation procedure and there was no PV injury, in-hospital mortality, or necessity of reoperation because of bleeding. Circumferential PV catheter ablations were performed within a mean of 39±14 minutes of RF energy. The catheter group had a statistically longer procedure time for the entire ablation (231±27 minutes) than the surgical group for the entire operation (143.4±26.2 minutes) (P = 0.016). One patient with AF rhythm suffered from stroke in the surgical group, due to poor anticoagulation status (international normalized ratio<2.0 ), but recovered without any sequelae before discharge.\nThe changes in the cardiac rhythms during stay in hospital are described in Table 2. During ablation, AF termination (conversion in SR) was seen in 34.9% of the catheter group and in 45.7% of the surgical group of patients, respectively (P = 0.15). AF organization into AFL occurred more often in the catheter group, 24 patients (28.9%), 13 right sided and 11 left sided, than in the surgical group, 5 patients (6.0%), 2 right sided and 3 left sided (P<0.001). AF was documented to be 39.8% in total of the two groups. Temporary pacemakers were used in 4 patients from the surgical group because of bradycardia.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 2.  Cardiac Rhythm in Hospital.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0022122.t002During hospitalization, AF and AFL recurred in 16 (19.3%) and 22 (26.5%) of the patients in the catheter group after a mean time of 2.0±1.5 days, and 12 (14.5%) and 2 (2.4%) patients in the surgical group after a mean time of 6.0±1.4 days, respectively (P = 0.70 and P<0.001). At discharge from the hospital, SR and AF was maintained in 86.8% and 4.8% of the patients in the catheter group and 63.9% and 28.9% in the surgical group respectively (P<0.001).\nThe average length of stay in hospital was 6.1±2.6 and 4.8±2.5 days in the surgical group and catheter group, respectively (P = 0.56).\n\n\n3.2 Follow-up Results\nAverage followed-up was 2.2years (range 1.0 to 3.6 years) after the procedures. During the follow-up period, two patients (2.4%) died in the catheter group, one for unknown reason and the other one with encephalorraghia. One patient (1.2%) died in the surgical group for unknown reason.\nTaking a blanking period of 3 months after surgery into account, 49 (59.0%) and 62 patients (74.7%) did not have a ‘single’ registration of AF during follow-up in the catheter group and surgical group respectively (P = 0.047). Additionally, patients in the catheter group had a significantly higher rate of recurrent arrhythmia (P = 0.011, hazard ratio: 0.555, 95% CI: 0.354 to 0.872).

Freedom from recurrence after AF ablation.CI = confidence interval.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0022122.g002In the catheter group, a second ablation procedure was performed in 23 patients with arrhythmia recurrence. Following the 2nd redo procedure, a third redo ablation was performed in 6 patients. Two patients who had failed the third redo ablation were treated then with the surgical procedure and were free from AF after follow-up.\nFive patients with recurrent AF, within the surgical group, who agreed to a second treatment, underwent a catheter ablation successfully. Two of these patients were proven to have a bidirectional block based on tests performed during the surgery suffered recurrent AF. Subsequent CARTO electrophysiologic mapping showed complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) in both atriums. The CFAEs ablation converted AF into atrial tachycardia, with the average AF cycle length of the 2 patients increasing from 140±12 ms to 214±23 ms after CFAEs ablation. Three-dimensional activation time-sequence mapping of the left atrium, combined with entrainment mapping, was then performed to clarify the underlying focal or macroreentry mechanism. The resulted “Entrainment” refers to higher tachycardia that occurs consistently during high frequency pacing; when the pacing frequency stops or is reduced below the original tachycardia, the tachycardia will drop back to a baseline level. The two patients were found to have several focal gaps originating from the roof and bottom of PVI lines. One of them a gap originating from the roof of the left superior PV down to the left inferior PV. In the third patient with atrial tachycardia a microreentrant cycle around the base of occlusive left appendage was found. An entrainment was performed to verify the reentrant mechanism. Interruption of the circuit as well as ablation of CFAEs mainly located at the posterior of the left atrial terminated the arrhythmia in this patient. The forth patient suffering AFL was identified anticlockwise (anterior of left atrial bottom area to posterior left atrial roof), with the average AF cycle length 302 ms. Ablation at the atrial roof between the two superior PVs, and ablation of CFAEs terminated the AFL. The fifth patients had mitral valve annulus-related atrial flutter. The creation of lesions from the left inferior PV to the mitral valve annulus was required to terminate the AFL in this patient. At the latest follow-up, all five patients were free of arrhythmias and independent of antiarrhythmic drug (AAD).\nFrequently, the decision to terminate AAD was made after 3-month monitoring. For patient who had a successful procedure, the freedom from AAD was 44.6% and 61.4% in catheter group and surgical group respectively (P = 0.043).\nDuring the follow-up, cerebrovascular accidents occurred in two patients (2.4%) of the surgical group, and in one patient (1.2%) of the catheter group. The 1- and 3- year actuarial survival free from stroke rates were both 99.0%±1.0% in the catheter group, and both 96.0%±1.5% in the surgical group, respectively (P = 0.27).\nEleven (6.6%) patients had to undergo preoperative permanent pacemaker implantation because of sick SR. During the follow-up, in three patients (3.6%) permanent pacemakers were implanted in the catheter group and in one patient (1.2%) of the surgical group. The 1- and 3- year actuarial survival free from implanting permanent pacemaker were both 97.0%±2.0% in the catheter group, and 100% and 97.0±3.0% in surgical group, respectively (P = 0.20).\n\nThis is the first case-matched retrospective study comparing catheter and video-assisted minimally invasive ablation techniques in patients with long-standing persistent AF. Although at discharge from the hospital, the maintenance of SR was higher in the catheter group, we found that minimally invasive ablation resulted in long-term maintenance of SR in 74.7 percent of the patients (vs. 59.0% in the catheter group, P = 0.047). Additionally, a Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients in the catheter group had a significantly higher rate of recurrent arrhythmia.Catheter-based PVI is relatively effective in maintaining SR for paroxysmal AF (65% to 70% success rate); for non paroxysmal AF, however, the PVI success rate is dramatically lower (20% to 30%) [10]–[12]. Therefore, different strategies adjunctive to PVI or using other concepts have been developed. These strategies include: creation of various ablation lines (mitral isthmus, roof line, posterior lines to isolate the posterior wall); ablation based on the CFAEs as well as cardiac autonomic denervation [13]–[16]. Oral et al evaluated catheter ablation with chronic AF. After a follow-up period of 7–14 months, only a mean of 33% of patients were in SR [17]. Tilz et al reported on 205 consecutive patients with long-standing persistent AF who underwent PVI, left linear and CFAEs catheter ablation. After a mean of 1.7±0.8 procedures, 135 of 199 patients (67.8%) remained in SR. Eighty-six patients (43.2%) remained in SR following PVI performed as the sole ablative strategy [16] and our results are in accordance with these previous reports who also adopted this technique. The PVI procedure appears to have a low success rate; however, the comparative advantages of a minimally invasive procedure have not been systematically evaluated yet.The success rate achieved in the most challenging surgical groups of patients, those with long-standing persistent AF, was not clear. Earlier in our series, the long-standing persistent AF group shows 44.4% and 71.4% SR restoration rates at 3 and 6 months postoperatively, respectively [18]. Similar research also reports 67% and 72% success rates, respectively [19], [20].Meanwhile our results show an optimistic therapeutic effect for long-standing persistent AF. This could be either due to a successful addition of bipolar ablation or due to the additional GP-ablation. During the minimally invasive operation, the energy is delivered between the jaws together with a transmurality feedback algorithm, and the transmurality of the isolation lesion is theoretically ensured. Besides the transmurality algorithm and facilitated multiple isolation lesions, the epicardial electrophysiologic testing further helps to evaluate the quality of the atrial lesion. What needs to be specially mentioned is that there are possible (24 patients in the surgical group (28.9%)) persistent regular and small potentials sensed even if ablations were done on a certain side. Often, these diminutive potentials recorded after ablation can represent “far-field” left atrial potentials. The effect of this “positive” postablation sensing and GP detection results on short-term and midterm therapeutic outcomes is under observation in a concurrent study. In this study pacing results show that all patients who were in SR after bilateral ablations did not show “atrial and ventricular capture” and accordingly achieved “exit block”.Investigators have showed that conversion of a premature depolarisation to AF depends on GP stimulation [21]. They could even initiate ectopic foci from the PV by GP stimulation alone. It is clear that the autonomic nervous system plays a key role in the initiation and maintenance of AF. Pappone first showed that patients with a vagal response during ablation had a higher success rate in comparison to patients without a vagal response [22]. Scherlag were the first to compare PVI with and without GP-ablation in a prospective study [23]. The follow-up data suggest better outcome with additional GP-ablation. The reported success rates vary between 29% and 84% [24]. Earlier in our series, ectopic foci outside the PV played an important role in persistent AF [19]. GP-ablation is, therefore, expected to contribute to the success of procedures for long-standing persistent AF.This study supports the feasibility of amputation of the LAA through the minimally invasive technique. In addition after amputation of the LAA, postoperative thromboembolic events were substantially reduced. During the follow-up, only two patients had cerebrovascular events.The main limitation of this study is the retrospectivity. A larger, randomized and prospective trial with catheter based and minimally invasive ablation for lone AF is underway and will better define the efficacy of these two procedures in accordance with published guidelines.A second limitation is that PVI with GP-ablation is not adequate to treat long-standing persistent AF. Patients with long-standing persistent AF pose a challenge because various pathophysiologic changes that occur in the atria of such patients may adversely affect the success of various treatment strategies. We reported electrophysiologic findings in patients presenting with recurrent atrial arrhythmia after minimally invasive procedures. Gaps at the roof and bottom of the PVI ring may contribute to the underlying mechanism of recurrent arrhythmias [18]. The connecting lesions between the left superior PV and left appendage and right inferior PV to the mitral valve annulus, as well as the roof line of the LA are all important; however, it is difficult to ablate these sites when the heart is beating using the present device during minimally invasive procedures. With the recently available Coolrail (AtriCure, Inc, West Chester, Ohio, USA), totally left-sided maze III lesion sets can be achieved relatively easy. In long-standing persistent AF, the efficacy of this procedure could benefit from its more extensive lesion set.Our results suggest that in patients with long-standing persistent AF, the minimally invasive PVI with GP-ablation had the better ability to maintain SR. A further randomized study assessing the role of minimally invasive surgery in AF patients seems to be justified."

            "fulltext": "IntroductionOver the past few years, the worldwide volume of healthcare and clinical research data generated has been significantly expanded [1]–[3]. Data sources now encompass multiple registries and clinical trials as well as the progressive implementation of hospital administration and electronic health record (EHR) systems [1]–[6]. As a special case of data collection systems, medical device registries have been essential to guide improvements in technology and to facilitate the refinement of patient selection in order to maximize outcomes with current and new device options [4], [5], [7], [8]. Studies derived from well-designed and well-conducted medical devices registries can provide a real-world view of clinical practice, patient outcomes, safety, comparative effectiveness and cost effectiveness and may strengthen a number of evidence development and decision making process [4], [5], [7]–[14].\nDespite its huge potential for both biomedical research as well as the potential to positively affect clinical practice and healthcare policies, medical registries are frequently surrounded by process problems that substantially decrease their value [4], [15], [16]. These include missing data and poor data quality, which is related to how the research component of the registry is connected to clinical workflow and how personnel involved in the data collection are trained [4]. Compatibility problems with other health registries or publicly available data sets, which are associated with how data elements are structured and defined to accomplish the registry's intended purposes are other weakness presented in large quantity of electronic medical registries [4], [17]–[20].\nAlthough web-based electronic data capture (EDC) systems have become more prevalent across the globe, the data collection for research purposes is still a challenging process [4], [20]–[22]. Lack of harmonization between the clinical and research workflows is time consuming for both clinical staff and patients [23], [24]. In addition, many hospitals and healthcare facilities that participate in studies present different data capture systems for both healthcare and research settings resulting in effort duplication, ultimately leading to data inconsistency [4], [18]–[20].\nAdopting standardized data elements and a common terminology is arguably the key to facilitate the exchange of data across studies and to promote interoperability between different EHRs systems [4], [17]–[20]. The objective of this study is therefore to describe a reproducible, highly scalable, standard framework for a device registry implementation addressing both local data quality components as well as global linking problems. In the first section of our article we set the theoretical background, while in the second section we provide a clinical use case involving a pacemaker registry implementation designed to systematically collect interpretable long-term safety and outcomes data.\nMethods\nRegistry description\nThe Pacemaker Registry Open Data Collection is derived from the SAFE-LV PACE randomized trial (“Safety and the Effects of Isolated Left Ventricular Pacing in Patients With Bradyarrhythmias,” ClinicalTrials.gov study ID NCT01717469). This randomized controlled study is being conducted to compare the effects of conventional right ventricular (RV) pacing versus left ventricular (LV) pacing in patients with atrioventricular block. Our main hypothesis is that isolated LV pacing through the coronary sinus can be used safely and provide greater hemodynamic benefits to patients with atrioventricular block and normal ventricular function who require only the correction of heart rate. Specifically, our aims are to evaluate the safety, efficacy and the effects of LV pacing using active-fixation coronary sinus lead – Attain StarFix® Model 4195 OTW Lead, compared to RV pacing in patients with implantation criteria for conventional pacemaker stimulation.\nIn this registry we are creating a large and interoperable database to report pacemaker long-term outcomes. All clinical data stored will maintain full patient confidentiality according to Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) [25] and will be freely available to allow collaboration between researchers around the world. Main advantages of this open data collection include the incentive for interdisciplinary and multi-institutional collaborations, along with the creation of clinical and policy measures in a more timely manner.\n\n\nGlocal registry methodology\nThe Institutional Review Board of the Clinics Hospital of the University of São Paulo Medical School (São Paulo, Brazil) approved this study. All participating subjects provided written informed consent. All elements in this article comply with a reproducible research protocol [26].\nThe device registry implementation comprised a group of generic processes successfully applied to project management, including the initiation, planning, execution, monitoring and controlling, and closing. The sequence included: (1) data planning used to define the common data standards and terminology as well as the representation of the research workflow, (2) development of electronic case report forms using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), (3) the process of data collection according to the clinical research workflow, (4) the aggregation between the registry data and other systems, (5) data quality control and data analysis using statistical methods and, finally (6) the data dissemination through the registry Web site (Figure 1).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.  Registry processes representation.Legend: ACC/AHA =  American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association; CDISC =  Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium; CRF =  Case Report Form; HL7 =  Health Level Seven; NCDR =  National Cardiovascular Data Registry; REDCap =  Research Electronic Data Capture.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0071090.g001\n\nDefining Data Elements\nOver the last few years, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have started an initiative to develop and publish clinical data standards that can be used in a variety of data collection efforts for a range of cardiovascular conditions [27], [28]. The ACC/AHA Writing Committee to Develop Clinical Data Standards for Electrophysiology was charged with providing standard definitions to relevant terms in the care of patients with a diagnosis of arrhythmia and implanted cardiac electronic devices [29].\nOur registry adopted all applicable data elements and definitions in accordance with ACC/AHA available published data standards, including those developed for Electrophysiology, Atrial Fibrillation, Acute Coronary Syndromes, Heart Failure, and Cardiac Imaging [29]–[33]. Other data sources included data elements from large device clinical trials and registries, such as CTOPP (Canadian Trial of Physiologic Pacing) [34], MOST (Mode Selection Trial in Sinus Node Dysfunction) [35], COMPANION (Comparison of Medical Therapy, Pacing, and Defibrillation in Heart Failure) [36], REVERSE (REsynchronization reVErses Remodeling in Systolic Left vEntricular Dysfunction) [37]. We also reviewed case report forms, data elements, and definitions from international data collection efforts. Examples of these data sources include the ACC National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) [38], [39], Health Level Seven International (HL7) [40], Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) [41] and Cancer Data Standards Registry and Repository (caDSR) [42], [43]. Finally, we also included standardized definitions for clinical endpoints and adverse events in cardiovascular trials from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [44].\n\n\nDefining the Registry Workflow – Clinical Activity Model\nBased on discussions with practicing clinicians and participatory observation of the clinic by two of the authors (KRS and RC), UML (Unified Modeling Language) activity diagram models were prepared to represent the clinical registry as well as the data collection workflow. A comparison of these clinical and data collection workflow models was then conducted to ensure the detection of potential areas where the activities related to data collection might not be in perfect alignment with the activities executed in the daily clinical workflow, ultimately leading to data quality issues, rework, and other processes inefficiencies. These diagrams were modeled according to UML version 2.0 [45]. All activity diagrams were created using ArgoUML (version 0.34) [46].\n\n\nElectronic Data Collection\nOnce the absence of potential workflow dissonance was ensured through the modeling, electronic case report forms (CRFs) were developed using the REDCap [21] EDC tool hosted at a local server within the firewall of the University of São Paulo Health System. REDCap is a secure web-based software and workflow methodology for electronic collection and management of research data (Figure 2). Among other characteristics it provides (1) an intuitive interface for validated data entry, with automated data type and range checks; (2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures, (3) automated data export procedures to common statistical packages, and (4) procedures for importing data from external sources [21]. Research coordinators performed data capture by using a tablet computer through a secure Wi-Fi, ultimately allowing for portable data collection at the point of care.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 2.  REDCap Data Entry.Footnote: Case report forms are accessible to users who have sufficient access rights and it contains field-specific validation code sufficient to ensure data integrity.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0071090.g002\n\nPersonnel Training for Data Collection\nWe performed a semi-structured training with the clinical research coordinators. Our goal was to provide a general overview of the registry database, while concurrently identifying specific factors which could compromise the integrity of the data collection. To ensure a standardized and consistent data collection we developed a standard operating procedure (SOP) specifically related to the primary data collectors tasks. This SOP provides a description of all data elements collected as well as the sources used to obtain the data.\nAfter the training process, the data entry activities of clinical research coordinators were closely monitored for three months by the principal investigators (RC and KRS) to assess whether data collection was conducted according to the study protocol. We used the REDCap report tool for monitoring and querying patient records. Corrective actions were taken to address problems related to data inconsistency and missing information, involving retraining and immediate feedback on issues such as missing, out-of-range values and logical inconsistencies.\n\n\nData Augmentation\nThe purpose of data augmentation was to augment variables to the research component of our pacemaker registry data sets from clinical and administrative sources, ultimately enhancing our ability to evaluate important research questions. The original dataset was augmented by incorporating data derived from three different instances: (1) EHR from the Clinics Hospital of the University of São Paulo Medical School (HCFMUSP); (2) Brazilian governmental database and (3) Linked Open Data (LOD) Collection. In the following section we describe the methodology used to perform the data integration across these sources.\nLinking Registry Data with Local Electronic Health Records.Whereas the study is being conducted at Heart Institute (InCor) – Clinics Hospital of the University of São Paulo Medical School, all demographics characteristics as well as healthcare information are available in several databases from legacy systems. Given the heterogeneity of these multidatabase systems, each patient has a unique identifier (ID) making it possible to associate the right health information with the right individual.\nIn order to avoid duplicate data entry, the EHR from the Clinics Hospital of the University of São Paulo Medical School (HCFMUSP) was integrated to the EDC through the REDCap API (Application Program Interface). The REDCap API is an interface that allows external applications to connect to REDCap remotely, and it is used for programmatically retrieving or modifying data or settings within REDCap. As the API is a built-in feature of REDCap, no installation is required and this tool implements the use of tokens as a means of authenticating and validating all API requests that are received. In addition, the API also implements data validation when the API is used for data import purposes in order to ensure that only valid data will be stored. By using the REDCap API, it was possible to retrieve useful demographic information directly from the sources of hospital systems.\n\nLinking Registry Data and Governmental Database.The original data set was augmented by incorporating publicly available data from the Brazilian governmental database known as DATASUS (Information Technology Department of the Brazilian Unified Health System, or SUS) [47]. This database produces a significant volume of information and provides the reimbursed values by the government for public healthcare organizations in both inpatient and outpatient care systems. For inpatients the common unit describing hospital charges is the hospital admission authorization, which is in accordance with the Hospital Information System. In addition, this database provides other information such as: reasons for hospitalization, length of hospital stay, socio-demographic characteristics, diagnoses, medical procedures, healthcare service providers and also the values paid for each procedure performed by public healthcare organizations.\nWe created a repository to store all anonymized data derived from DATASUS under the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud – Amazon EC2 [48]. This repository hosts a MySQL server where the database is available in a normalized format. In this repository, we have stored a set of databases that comprises the basis for hospital accountability of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS), in which all diagnoses and procedures are coded according to ICD-10. Through this repository was possible to retrieve useful information such as reimbursed values by the government for pacemaker implantation as well as length of hospital stay.\nThis database is available in CSV (comma separated values) format files and all data are updated monthly on the Web site of DATASUS.\n\nLinking Registry Data with Linked Open Data Collections.In addition, we also enriched our registry by adding open semantic web data source for clinical trials named Linked Clinical Trials (LinkedCT) [49]. Each clinical trial in this database is associated with a brief description of the trial, related conditions, interventions, eligibility criteria, sponsors, locations and other additional information. This mapping was implemented by means of a SPARQL query interconnecting our dataset with the Linked Life Data (LLD) endpoint [50]. This approach enables the identification of correlated clinical trials and investigators in order to generate new opportunities for scientific collaboration.\n\nData de-identification.All data – including images, lab tests and any associated information – were de-identified before insertion into the repository as required by HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) regulations to ensure that protected health information (PHI) was not inappropriately used or disclosed [25]. The de-identification was performed by indicating a variable as PHI element during the project development process in REDCap and also by selecting those variables prior to exporting the data.\n\nData modeling resources.Our data repository also contains an instance of the R statistical language (version 2.15.1) [51], along with the RStudio Server version 0.96 IDE (integrated development environment). Through this infrastructure users can easily manipulate statistical scripts, generate reports, and directly upload them to the server on the same environment.\n\n\n\nData quality control, association and prediction reports\nWe established a system to generate automated data quality control and prediction reports based on the R statistical language. This system involves a set of packages enabling literate programming and reproducible research standards to automatically transform the statistical results into a real-time reports deployed in HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and PDF (Portable Document Format), both available from our central Web site [52]. Reports are created using the knitr package [53] and the Markdown language [54] in combination with R [51]. Specifically, we use R Markdown files with subsequent transformations to HTML and PDF performed through pandoc [55]. Documents are then presented on our Web server through the rApache package [56], ultimately ensuring that data quality reports are maintained up to date. Scripts for all of our procedures are available at our Github repository [57].\nAssociation reports are also provided as a mechanism for exploratory graphical analysis. Among them, we included the MINE (Maximal Information-based Nonparametric Exploration) algorithm [58], a sophisticated, robust algorithm used for exploratory analyses. Extensive use of exploratory graphical methods is facilitated by the use of the R package ggplot2 [59], along with other methods for data manipulation. Additional integrated services included the use of BigQuery [60] for manipulating large data sets as well as Google prediction services [61].\n\n\nOpen Design\nIn order to provide incentives for other researchers to join the collaboration and start creating analyses using the dataset, we have created a special section on our Web site [52] and Github repository [57] with a data dictionary and de-identified data sets in an Open Data format.\n\nResults\nPacemaker Registry Detailed Use Case\nThe use case model describes the process of information exchange involved in our pacemaker registry, detailing the infrastructure developed to enable interoperability between the EHR and REDCap. For this use case, the workgroup has prioritized the electronic data capture of standardized data elements in order to leverage a core set of widely useful clinical data from EHR systems to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of clinical research activities. The following diagram (Figure 3) illustrates the stakeholders involved in the processes described in this use case.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 3.  Pacemaker Registry Use Case Stakeholders.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0071090.g003Indication of pacemaker implantation in a patient presenting bradyarrhythmia is the condition determining the start of this use case. By assessing patients, healthcare team entered demographic and clinical data into the EHR. Research coordinators identify subjects for the study based upon whether they meet the protocol eligibility criteria. Once study subjects were enrolled in the study, a core set of data may be exchanged from the clinical EHR system to REDCap as previously described in the “Linking Registry Data with Local Electronic Health Records” section. Research coordinators were responsible for completing the data retrieve from the EHR into the REDCap as well as for electronic data capture of additional study-specific data during the course of the study. All collected data is transmitted to the Data Work Group for validation and later to the Research Investigators Team. The Data Work Group is responsible for data maintenance, information exchange, and data aggregation with other databases.

This workflow illustrates the process of patient care throughout diagnosis, assessment, treatment, and long-term monitoring of patients undergoing pacemaker implantation. In addition, this registry workflow was aligned with the clinical workflow to enhance quality of the data captured and also facilitate understanding of the clinical care and research processes as a common reference by both clinicians and technologists (Figure 5).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 5.

We also used variables derived from cardiac devices randomized trials [34]–[37], as well as NCI Thesaurus and CDISC data standards [42], [43]. (Table 2) The authors added specific pacemaker data elements which are not yet available in the standardization sources used in this study. Data standards for each variable class are detailed in Supporting Information (Table S1).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 2.

Data association and prediction plots were generated based on boxplots for reports of numeric data and association plots for categorical data. We also used the application of the MINE algorithm [58] to explore the association between two pairs of numeric variables, both linear and nonlinear.

Pacemaker Registry Open Data Collection.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0071090.t005\nThe foundational work to create this pacemaker registry is part of a broader program to address the lack of data interoperability between the clinical and research settings. In this manuscript, we describe the infrastructure behind our Pacemaker Registry involving a diversity of steps such as: a comprehensive database planning, the alignment between research and clinical workflows, the adoption of clinical data standards, the development of electronic case report forms using REDCap, the aggregation between registry data and other systems and, finally the open data collection dissemination by the registry Web site.This methodological study is also an effort to implement glocal (global and local) data integration through a reproducible research protocol, which can be applied to other medical registries. In the scope of our study, “global” integration involves the adoption of global data standards and data interchange to facilitate information sharing within and across institutions. “Local” integration implies in integrating workflow between research and healthcare settings, and also in the interoperability between EHR and EDC systems.Successful registries depend on a sustainable workflow model that should be aligned to the daily clinical practice with minimal disruption [1]–[8]. Previous studies suggested [23], [24], [44] that workflow efficiency is a valuable factor for enhancing data quality and integrity since inefficient process may result in errors related to data collection and transcription, as well as unnecessary redundancy in the data collection [4], [5], [18]–[20]. In our study, we have made an effort to align the EDC system with the clinical workflow and we are currently working on the integration between EHR and EDC systems. In particular, the REDCap functionalities allowed us to develop an efficient interface between healthcare and research data collection, enabling the reuse of EHR data.For the development of interoperability and internationalization of our registry we focused firstly on data standards by using all existing standards terminologies whenever possible. It included all standard terminologies published by ACC/AHA [28]–[33], as well as data elements derived from large device clinical trials and other sources as NCDR [38], [39], HL7 [40], CDISC [41] and caDSR [42], [43]. The use of established data standards is crucial for semantic interoperability between information systems, which will be increasingly important as the use of electronic health information system is becoming widely available around the globe. It is also important to consider that the adoption of data standard terminologies not only improves the efficiency in establishing registries but also promote more effective sharing, combining, or linking of data sets from different sources and institutions. In addition, the use of well-defined standards for data elements ensures that the meaning of data captured in different systems is the same.Several different methods can be applied for the assurance of data quality and quality control in medical registries [4]–[6]. These methods may include site visits, ongoing training programs, use of standardized definitions and regular audits of the data for completeness and consistency [4]–[6]. The importance, registries should probably monitor not only data quality but also associations and clinical predictions. In order to monitor data quality, we established a system to generate automated data quality control and prediction reports based on the statistical language R [51]. As our registry is an ongoing study, the results provided here are empirical examples from a limited number of patients. However, automated data quality control and prediction reports will be frequently updated and will be available under our data repository [57].The demand for timely real-world data to support decision-making has driven the development of an increasing numbers of open data collections [17]–[20]. Adoption of open data policy is being encouraged not only by the U.S. government but globally by the editors of peer-reviewed journals [67]. Of the importance, open global databases are inherently necessary to accelerate the speed of evidence-based medicine and for an efficient, cost-effective healthcare system to improve the quality of patient care [1]–[8], [17]–[20]. Within our Open Data Collection protocol, socio-demographic, comorbidities and clinical characterization of patients undergoing pacemaker implantation will be publicly available in real time on a clouded-based repository following the concept of open data collection and under privacy, security and confidentiality policies (HIPAA) [25]. In addition to the data made available within clinicaltrials.gov, these variables will assist in the characterization of the study population for proper interpretation of published study results. The most important aspect of this approach is to foster a continuum between clinical care and clinical research leveraging the evidence development which may be successfully translated into better patient outcomes.Using data derived from a randomized clinical trial is both a limitation and strength of our study. While randomized clinical trials are often conducted under high scientific methodological standards, their generalizability could be limited by including selected populations. On the other hand, the randomization of patients included in our registry will allow the comparison of long-term outcomes between different treatment alternatives, which is a key strength of this open registry collection. Implementation of other technology solutions such as integration with a platform for adverse events monitoring, protocols for data augmentation through natural language processing (NLP), open literature repositories connected to R Markdown files and protocols for enhance patients follow-up are future perspectives that will guide our next efforts. Finally, this registry can not only be used for the comparison of data within pacemaker patients but also as a source for comparison and benchmarking between different conditions within and between institutions. We believe that the framework proposed in this article can be a useful tool for creating high quality and interoperable medical registries."

                "\nThe HACEK organisms (Haemophilus species, Aggregatibacter species, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella species) are rare causes of infective endocarditis (IE). The objective of this study is to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with HACEK endocarditis (HE) in a large multi-national cohort. Patients hospitalized with definite or possible infective endocarditis by the International Collaboration on Endocarditis Prospective Cohort Study in 64 hospitals from 28 countries were included and characteristics of HE patients compared with IE due to other pathogens. Of 5591 patients enrolled, 77 (1.4%) had HE. HE was associated with a younger age (47 vs. 61 years; p<0.001), a higher prevalence of immunologic/vascular manifestations (32% vs. 20%; p<0.008) and stroke (25% vs. 17% p = 0.05) but a lower prevalence of congestive heart failure (15% vs. 30%; p = 0.004), death in-hospital (4% vs. 18%; p = 0.001) or after 1 year follow-up (6% vs. 20%; p = 0.01) than IE due to other pathogens (n = 5514). On multivariable analysis, stroke was associated with mitral valve vegetations (OR 3.60; CI 1.34–9.65; p<0.01) and younger age (OR 0.62; CI 0.49–0.90; p<0.01). The overall outcome of HE was excellent with the in-hospital mortality (4%) significantly better than for non-HE (18%; p<0.001). Prosthetic valve endocarditis was more common in HE (35%) than non-HE (24%). The outcome of prosthetic valve and native valve HE was excellent whether treated medically or with surgery. Current treatment is very successful for the management of both native valve prosthetic valve HE but further studies are needed to determine why HE has a predilection for younger people and to cause stroke. The small number of patients and observational design limit inferences on treatment strategies. Self selection of study sites limits epidemiological inferences.\n"

            "fulltext": "IntroductionThe HACEK group of bacteria (Haemophilus species, Aggregatibacter species, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella species) are a small, heterogeneous group of fastidious, gram-negative bacteria that frequently colonize the oropharynx and have long been recognised as a cause of infective endocarditis (IE). These organisms have been historically reported as causing infection in <5% of patients of IE [1], [2], and 0.8–6% of patients in recent population-based studies [3]–[5].\nDue to the relative rarity of HACEK endocarditis (HE), the clinical description and outcome has, of necessity, been derived from compilation of data from small case series and case reports [6]–[10]. These reports are limited by non-standardized data collection and selective reporting of patients. Consequently, the features of HE identified cannot be compared rigorously with other forms of IE.\nThe International Collaboration on Endocarditis Prospective Cohort Study (ICE-PCS) was designed to provide a large multi-national resource of prospectively collected, well defined patients of IE using a standardised data set. The objective is to improve understanding of the clinical characteristics and outcome of IE in a multi-national cohort of patients. In this report we describe the characteristics of patients with HE, and compare the risk factors, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of HE with IE caused by other pathogens (non-HE).\nPatients and Methods\nDatabase\nICE-PCS has been described previously [11], [12]. Briefly, participating members from 64 sites in 28 countries reported patients prospectively on a standard case report form from June 2000 through to September 2006. The case report form included 275 variables and was developed by ICE collaborators according to standard definitions [11]. All patients were included from sites that met performance criteria for participation. These criteria include the following: minimum enrolment of 12 patients per year in a centre with access to cardiac surgery; the presence of patient identification measures to ensure consecutive enrolment and to minimise ascertainment bias [11]; high quality data with query resolution.\n\n\nEthical Statement\nInitial institutional review board approval for ICE-PCS came from the Duke International Centre. All participating sites had institutional review board or ethical committee approval or a waiver and informed consent (verbal or written) or a waiver of consent from all patients based on local standards as required by the Duke Coordinating Centre.\n\n\nStudy Sample\nPatients in the ICE-PCS database were included in this study if they had definite or possible IE according to the modified Duke's criteria. HACEK isolates were identified and antibiotic susceptibility testing performed in the participating centres. Antibiotic therapy was decided by the treating physician at the individual study site.\n\n\nDefinitions\nInfective endocarditis was defined according to the modified Duke Criteria [13]. Infective endocarditis was considered to be left sided if no right sided (tricuspid or pulmonary valve) vegetations were present on echocardiographic examination, surgery, or autopsy. Community-acquired IE was defined as signs or symptoms of IE developing before hospitalization in a patient without extensive out-of-hospital contact with health care interventions or systems. Hospital acquired IE was defined as symptom onset and diagnosis occurring in a patient hospitalized for more than 48 hours.Health care–associated infection was defined as cases in which signs or symptoms consistent with infective endocarditis developed before hospitalization in patients with extensive out-of-hospital contact with health care interventions. Extensive out of hospital intervention included one or more of the following,(1) receipt of intravenous therapy, wound care, or specialized nursing care at home within the 30 days prior to the onset of IE; (2) visiting a hospital or hemodialysis clinic or receiving intravenous chemotherapy within the 30 days before the onset of IE; (3) hospitalization in an acute care hospital for 2 or more days in the 90 days before the onset of IE; or (4) residing in a nursing home or long-term care facility[14], [15].\nCancer was defined as any malignant neoplasm except basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. The category “other chronic diseases” included connective tissue or rheumatologic disease, chronic liver or kidney disease, chronic neurological conditions, and other chronic infectious and inflammatory conditions. A diagnosis of heart failure was accepted on the basis of clinical evaluation performed by the care team and defined according to the New York Heart Association classification system [16]. Stroke was defined as an acute neurological deficit of vascular aetiology lasting more than 24 hours [17]. Systemic embolisation included embolisation to any organ including the skin. Valve surgery included all surgery performed on heart valves at any time during hospitalisation regardless of urgency. Rates of surgery and mortality include events that occurred during the index hospitalisation and one year follow-up. Repeat IE was defined as a further episode of IE fulfilling the modified Duke criteria. Confirmed relapse was defined as a repeat episode caused by the same microorganism on molecular analysis, as the preceding episode; confirmed new infection as a repeat episode caused by a different species or the same species but a different strain by molecular analysis; and possible relapse as repeat episode caused by a microorganism of the same species within 6 months of the initial episode without molecular analysis [18].\n\n\nGeographic regions\nGeographic regions participating in ICE included the following: United States (10 sites), South America (9 sites from Argentina, Brazil, and Chile), Europe (27 sites from Austria, Croatia, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom), Australia and New Zealand (9 sites), Asia and Middle East (8 sites in India, Israel, Lebanon, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and Thailand,) and South Africa (1 site).\n\n\nMicrobiological methods\nBlood cultures and sensitivity testing was performed by accredited laboratories using standard methods. Sensitivity testing was most commonly those of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous variables were represented as medians with 25th and 75th percentiles. Categorical variables were represented as frequencies and percentages of the specified group. Simple comparisons were made with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test or the chi square test as appropriate. For all tests, a p value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant. Missing data for each variable were excluded from the denominator. Variables found to have a simple association with the outcome of interest (p<0.10) were considered for the final multiple variable model in a stepwise fashion. The variables included in the final multiple variable adjusted regression model were selected based on a combination of statistical significance (p<0.05) and clinical judgment. The generalized estimating equation method was used to produce consistent parameter estimates that measure association between the incidence of outcome and clinical covariates while accounting for the correlation in treatment and outcomes of patients from the same hospital. Final parameter estimates were converted to ORs with corresponding 95% Wald CIs. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).\n\nResultsSeventy seven (1.4%) of 5591 patients diagnosed with IE in ICE-PCS had HACEK endocarditis (66 definite and 11 possible) and PVE was present in 27 (35%). The prevalence of HE differed significantly between the study sites (p = 0.009), with a low prevalence in North America and a high prevalence in Australia/New Zealand. The HE cases by region were: North America (5/992, 0.5%), South America (8/518, 1.5%), Australia/New Zealand (23/979, 2.3%), Europe (35/2806, 1.2%), Asia/Middle East (5/277, 1.8%), and Africa (1/19).\n\nFeatures of HE by species\nThe HACEK isolates were speciated in 76 (99%) cases with Haemophilus species the most common (40%) (Table 1). Of all HACEK species, only Kingella spp. was not associated with an episode of prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). PVE was more common in A. actinomycetemcomitans than H. parainfluenzae IE (10, 67% v 5, 18%; respectively p<0.01). Clinical manifestations of IE of more than 1 months duration were recorded more often in A. actinomycetemcomitans (8, 53%) and Cardiobacterium IE (6, 55%) than H. parainfluenzae (3, 11%; both p<0.01). Aortic valve vegetations were identified on echocardiography more commonly in Cardiobacterium IE (8, 89%) than in H. parainfluenzae (6, 32%; p<0.05) and A. actinomycetemcomitans (2, 29%; p<0.05) IE. Mitral valve endocarditis was common in H. parainfluenzae (10, 53%) and A. actinomycetemcomitans (6, 86%). Of the five cases with Oslers' nodes four occurred with A. actinomycetemcomitans IE.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 1.

The median age of patients with HE (47.4 years; IQR 35.6–57.1) was significantly lower than non-HE (60.5 years; IQR 45.3–72.7) and males predominated (56, 73%). Factors more commonly associated with HE than Non-HE endocarditis were Osler's nodes (7% vs 3%, p = 0.02) and vascular immunological phenomena (32% vs 20%, p = 0.008) and the presence of mechanical valves (30% vs 18%, p = 0.02). Factors less commonly associated with HE than non-HE endocarditis were health care provision (1% vs 24%, p<0.001), and diabetes mellitus (8% vs 18%, p = 0.02). There was no difference in the proportion with fever or splenomegaly between HE and non-HE, nor with native valve predisposition for IE or congenital heart disease (Table 2).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 2.  Important features of HACEK endocarditis compared with all other causes of infective endocarditis in database*.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0063181.t002\n\nTransfers from another facility\nThere was no difference in the number of cases transferred from another facility between HE (30, 39%) and non-HE (2288, 41%; p = 0.6). In HE there were more cases transferred with native valve endocarditis (24, 80% vs 23, 49%; p = 0.01 ), new or worsening murmurs (20, 67% vs 19, 40% p = 0.008), regurgitation on echocardiography (23, 77% vs 23, 49%; p = 0.02), and need for valvular surgery (aortic valve 11, mitral valve 12) ( 23, 77% vs 8, 17% p<0.001 ) compared with those directly admitted. There was a borderline significant increase in stroke among transferees (11, 38% vs 8, 17%; p = 0.06) and CHF (7, 32% vs 4 9%; p = 0.10) and no difference in the numbers of cases with symptoms longer than 1 month (5, 17% vs 13, 28% p = 0.41) or length of hospital stay (median 23 IQR 15–42 vs median 27 IQR 14–42, p = 0.56).\n\n\nDiagnosis\nBlood cultures were drawn in all 77 patients with HE. Three of four patients with negative blood cultures had received antibiotics in the previous seven days. Additional culture positive sites were heart valves (20), joint fluid (2), pacemaker wires (1), urine (1), and other (5). One patient was diagnosed by PCR of infected tissue. Echocardiography was performed in 97% of HE (transthoracic only 15, transesophageal only 9, both transthoracic and transesophageal 51). Vegetations were identified in a lower proportion in HE than non-HE (71% vs 83%, p = 0.01) (Table 2). There was no difference in the proportions of mitral and aortic valve vegetations identified between HE and non-HE. Only 1 case of tricuspid valve endocarditis was recorded in HE. New regurgitation and paravalvular complications were not significantly different from non-HE (Table 2).\n\n\nAntimicrobial susceptibility testing\nThe causative organisms are shown in table 1. Of the isolates tested 24/25 (96%) were penicillin susceptible (1 resistant strain of A. aphrophilus), 48/49 (98%) were ampicillin susceptible (1 resistant strain, of A. aphrophilus), 50/50 (100%) were ceftriaxone susceptible, and 30/32 (94%) were gentamicin susceptible (2 resistant strains of H. parainfluenzae).\n\n\nTreatment\nAntimicrobial therapy was reported in 50 (65%) patients. Of these 37 (74%) were treated with ceftriaxone (in combination with an aminoglycoside in 17 and ampicillin in 6) , 6 with a penicillin derivative (ampicillin in 3, penicillin G in 2, and penicillinase-resistant penicillin in one,in combination with an aminoglycoside), and 3 with cefazolin/cefalothin (in combination with an aminoglycoside), and 4 unspecified. All cases of HE were treated with antimicrobial agents that would be active as predicted by susceptibility testing. Cardiac surgery was performed on 31 (40%) patients a median of four days (IQR 1–19) after admission. The aortic valve was replaced in 17 patients, mitral valve in 13, tricuspid valve in one and an intracardiac device was removed in one patient.\n\n\nOutcomes\nThe in-hospital mortality of HE was less than one quarter that of the non-HE (3, 4% vs 998,18%; p<0.001). Of the three HE deaths with one had been treated surgically. Heart failure was significantly less frequent in HE than non-HE (15% vs. 30%, p = 0.004). Stroke complicated a higher proportion of cases with HE than non-HE (25% vs. 17%, p = 0.05) and there was a relative excess of haemorrhagic stroke over embolic stroke in HE (44% vs 17%, p = 0.006). The presence of a stroke increased the length of stay by 20 days despite occurring in a significantly younger age group (Table 3). On multivariable regression analysis the independent factors associated with stroke were increasing age in 10 year intervals (OR 0.62; CI 0.49–0.90; p<0.01) and mitral valve vegetations (OR 3.60; CI 1.34–9.65; p<0.01). Eleven of 25 (44%) cases of HE with mitral valve vegetations suffered a stroke compared with 484/2009 (24%) in non-HE (p = 0.03). The frequency of systemic embolization, excluding central nervous system, intracardiac abscess and mycotic aneurysm were not significantly different in HE than non-HE (Table 2).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 3.  Univariate and multivariate analysis for the risk of stroke in HACEK endocarditis*.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0063181.t003At one year follow-up, three additional cases of HE had died (heart failure 1, unrelated causes 1, unknown 1); however the cumulative death rate was significantly lower than non-HE (6,11% vs 1627, 39%; p<0.001) (Table 2). Four cases had undergone valvular surgery; three had been treated medically and one surgically.\nThere was one possible relapse 4 months after completing therapy with an unspecified HACEK organism. This organism was not available for further speciation. In addition one patient with HE had another episode of endocarditis with a methicillin susceptible S. aureus.\nHACEK native and prosthetic valve endocarditis.Comparison of the clinical features of native valve and prosthetic valve HE demonstrated that native valve HE occurred at an older age (median 56.3 (range 41–67) vs median 43.8 (range 32–54) years, p = 0.003), and that a higher proportion had Osler's nodes (5, 20% vs 0, 0%; p = 0.002) and systemic embolization (10, 37% vs 5, 12% v; p = 0.01) than prosthetic valve HE (Table 4). There was no significant difference in the proportion with stroke (7, 26% vs 11, 24%; p = 0.85), or congestive heart failure (5, 19% vs 6, 14%; p = 0.74) or surgical treatment (8, 30% vs 22, 45%; p = 0.23) or length of median hospital stay between these groups.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 4.  Comparison between the features of native valve HACEK endocarditis and prosthetic valve HACEK endocarditis*.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0063181.t004Of those with PVE 8 (30%) required surgical treatment and 19 (70%) were treated with medical therapy alone. There were no in-hospital deaths in either treatment group. Of the 24 PVE patients with 1 year follow-up data, there was one death (cause unknown) and three who required cardiac surgery in the medically treated group, but no deaths, relapses or further surgery requirement in the surgically treated group. By comparison, among those with native valve HE, there were two in-hospital deaths and 1 death with-in the 1 year follow-up period.\n\n\nThis report describes the findings of a large series of HE and non-HE cases of bacterial endocarditis reported in a standardised manner in which geographic distribution, frequency of clinical features, risk factors and outcomes have been compared. Both groups were subject to referral bias from transfers to the study centres [19], [20], but this is unlikely to confound these comparisons as the proportion transferred was very similar in the two groups, and the pattern of features of the transferees with HE was similar to that reported in the ICE cohort. However the frequency of some clinical features are influenced by transfers between hospitals, and the results need to be interpreted in the light of this limitation.The marked geographic difference in the prevalence of HE (10-fold) between the highest (New Zealand) and the lowest countries (United States of America) confirms the findings of an earlier, smaller sample of cases in the ICE cohort [11]. The range is similar to the range of 0.8–6.1% reported in recent single and multi-centre studies. [3]–[5]. The high prevalence of HE in New Zealand is unlikely to be due to referral patterns given the low proportion transferred from another facility. Other possible reasons for the variation include the prevalence of risk factors such as frequency of prosthetic devices [12], oral health [21], transmission pathways of HACEK organisms within populations [22], regional health care access, and diagnostic bias.Some clinical features varied with the causative species. H. parainfluenzae was the commonest cause of HE, as has been reported in population based studies [23]. H. parainfluenzae endocarditis was less likely to have an insidious onset than both A. actinomycetemcomitans and C. hominis confirming previous reports [7]. C. hominis was strongly associated with aortic valve infection and A. actinomycetemcomitans endocarditis was a frequent cause of PVE, and vascular immunological manifestations [6], [7], [9], [10]. Despite this, we found that HE has sufficient important clinical features in common that distinguish it from non-HE to retain clinical usefulness. These features include younger age of presentation, community acquisition, a higher proportion with vascular/immunological manifestations, a lower proportion with co-morbidities and an excellent outcome.Prosthetic valve endocarditis was common (35%), although the prevalence of HACEK PVE was not significantly higher than non-HE PVE in this study (p = 0.07). However, the comparator includes a heterogeneous group of organisms with variable propensity to cause PVE. For example, previous studies of the ICE cohort have found the proportion of PVE in Staphylococcus aureus IE to be 16%, viridans streptococcal IE to be 15%, and coagulase-negative staphylococcal IE to be 32% [11]. Thus it appears that HACEK organisms have a predilection for prosthetic valves. This finding is more marked in late PVE (>1 year after surgery) as HE causes late PVE in a large majority of cases [12], but only about half of cases of S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci PVE, suggesting mechanical valves are a particular risk for HE [17]. In addition this study may underestimate the true proportion with PVE because of the high number of native valve HE cases transferred from other centres. Pre-existing native valve and congenital cardiac abnormalities were common in HE but there was no significant increase in these conditions compared with non-HE. Previous studies have suggested these risk factors may occur more frequently in HE, but this will be subject to changes in the epidemiology of native valve lesions such as rheumatic fever and the widespread availability of cardiac surgery [22].Most cases of HE were treated with a third generation cephalosporin and a minority with ampicillin with or without an aminoglycoside; however there were insufficient cases to correlate outcomes with these recommended regimens [24], [25]. The incidence of penicillin resistant strains was limited to an isolate of A. aphrophilus species. β-lactamase producing strains of C. hominis have been reported but not in A. actinomycetemcomitans to our knowledge [26]. The proportion of all HE cases requiring cardiac surgery (40%) was similar to non-HE and to that reported in the literature [12], [27]. However in PVE the requirement for surgery was lower (30%) which compares favourably with published rates for PVE overall (49%) [12], [27]. The favourable outcome of both medically and surgically treated HACEK PVE demonstrates that HE is readily controlled and treated with antimicrobial agents despite the presence of a prosthetic valve.The outcome of HE was excellent overall with an in-hospital mortality of 3% which is less than one quarter of the mortality for non-HE and one sixth that of S. aureus endocarditis [28]. Heart failure was diagnosed in 15% of cases compared with 30% in non-HE, and 37% reported for S. aureus endocarditis [27], [28]. The younger age group and lack of co-morbidities, in addition to pathogen-specific characteristics may favour a good in-hospital and 1 year outcomes. These results would not be affected by survivor bias given the very high survival rate of HE. With respect to PVE, the numbers were too small to make meaningful comparison for other major complications including stroke, congestive heart failure and abscess formation.The major complication of HE was stroke (25%), and this complication almost doubled the length of hospitalisation. This figure over-represents the true incidence of stroke in HE as there was an increased frequency of stroke in those transferred from other facilities. Nevertheless stroke is conspicuously common in HE compared with non-HE, and the reported frequency in S. aureus endocarditis (20%) and viridans streptococcal IE (8%) in the ICE cohort [29]. Mitral valve IE was an important risk factor for stroke as reported previously, but organism specific effects on the nature of the vegetations in HE may also make a significant contribution to the prevalence of stroke, as 44% of patients with mitral valve HE suffering a stroke compared with 24% of non-HE. This may be related to the long antecedent history with organisms such as A. actinomycetemcomitans [7].While embolism was the predominant cause of stroke in HE there was relative excess of haemorrhagic stroke. The reasons for this are not clear but it is possible micro-vascular/immunological manifestations of IE which were significantly more frequent in HE than non-HE and might contribute to the development of cerebral microbleeds which are a strong predictor of subsequent intracranial haemorrhage [30]. Anticoagulant therapy is unlikely to contribute to the occurrence of stroke but may increase the conversion of embolic to haemorrhagic events. [31].There are several additional limitations of this study. Because of small numbers both possible and definite cases were included to increase statistical power. Despite this there were a limited number of cases of HACEK endocarditis and the observational design and long-term follow-up limited to one year limits our ability to draw any firm conclusions regarding optimal antimicrobial therapy or surgical treatment strategies. Furthermore the self selection of centres to participate in the ICE study, and the heavy weighting toward Europe, North America and Australasia with few sites in Asia, and Africa has meant that the population sample may not be representative of any specific region. Thus important geographical differences may have been missed and any epidemiological inferences from this study are limited.Our findings suggest that there is sufficient similarity in presentation and outcome to justify considering the HACEK organisms as a group at present. Despite the high prevalence of stroke, HE has a remarkably low mortality rate, suggesting that current antibiotic therapy with surgery when needed, is very effective. The reasons why HE shows apparent disparities in geographical distribution, occurs in a younger age group, has a propensity to infect prosthetic valves, and is associated with a high incidence of stroke are worthy of further investigation."

                "Objectives: Atrioventricular block (AVB) is a infrequent and serious complication after percutaneous ASD closure. In this study, we report on the incidence of AVB associated with intraoperative device closure of the ASD with transthoracic minimal invasion, and the outcomes of this complication in our center. Methods: Between May 2006 and January 2011, a total of 213 secundum-type ASD patients were accepted in our hospital for intraoperative and transthoracic device closure with a domestic occluder. All patients were assessed by real-time transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and electrocardiograph (ECG). Results: All patients were occluded successfully under this approach. Immediate postprocedure third-degree AVB was observed in two patients. Since heart rates were in the range of about 50 to 55 beats per minute, no intervention was needed except for close observation for one patient. Another patient who recovered sinus rhythm intermittently during the operation was fitted with a temporary pacemaker. Approximately one week following glucocorticoid treatment, the AVB resolved spontaneously in these two patients. Mobitz type II AVB occurred in three patients during the procedure. Two patients developed post-operative cardiac arrest and were rescued successfully with cardiopulmonary resuscitation. One other patient changed to Mobitz type I AVB after three days. During the follow-up period, which ranged from six months to five years, no further occurrence of AVB was found. Conclusions: Intraoperative and transthoracic device closure of secundum ASDs with domestic occluder resulted in excellent closure rate. AVB is an infrequent but serious complication during and after device closure of a secundum ASD. AVB is a complication that warrants greater attention and long-term follow-up. "

            "fulltext": "IntroductionAtrial septal defect(ASD) is one of the most common congenital cardiac defects, accounting for approximately 6% to 10% of all congenital cardiac defects. [1], [2] Transcatheter ASD closure has gradually matured as an alternative to surgical closure and has been employed increasingly in recent years, especially in cases of secundum ASD. Cases of secundum ASD have become more amenable to closure since the introduction of the Amplatzer occluder. The major advantage of transcatheter closure is that requires neither a median sternotomy nor cardiopulmonary bypass. In addition, the complication rate for transcatheter ASD closure, is lower than with surgery. [3]–[5] Short- and long-term follow-ups have revealed many of the shortcomings of device closure. [6]–[8] The two-percent incidence of arrhythmia after the device implantation is considerably lower than the thirty-percent incidence reported after surgical closure. [9] The most serious complication experienced by patients has been the occurrence of complete atrioventricular block (AVB). To our knowledge, there are few reports of studies involving large numbers of patients undergoing device closure of ASD. In this article, we reported the incidence of AVB during and after intraoperative and transthoracic device closure ASD using a domestic occluder in our center, as well as the outcome of the complications.\nMaterials and Methods\nDevice\nThe ASD occluder (Dong Guan Ke Wei Medical Apparatus Co. Ltd, China) was consisted of an occluder made from an alloy of nickel and titanium, a metal sheath, a pushing rod, and a hook. (Fig. 1) The double disc occluder had a loop on the right disc with a 100-cm thread through the loop, facilitating its withdrawal into the sheath, which was 40 cm in length and 4 to 10 mm in diameter sheath. The occluder for each patient was selected in accordance with the transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) result, with a diameter 2 to 6 mm in excess of the maximum defect diameter. The occluder was loaded into the sheath.

During the operation, TTE with a GE vivid 7 multiplane probe (General Electric Company) was used for the accurate determination of ASD location, morphologic features, size (the largest diameter), and visualization of rims. ASD diameter was measured by TTE using two-dimensional imaging and colour flow Doppler on long and short axis views. (Fig. 2) The atrial septal occluder was chosen according to the largest diameter of the ASD, allowed for a margin of 2 to 6 mm in excess of the diameter.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 2.  The 38 mm ASD measured by TTE.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0052726.g002Under general anesthesia, each patient was placed in a supine position and draped for exposure of the entire chest, with the right hemithorax elevated approximately 30 degrees. A right anterior submammary minithoracotomy (3–5 cm in length) was made through the fourth intercostal space, and a small rib spreader was used in the manipulation incision to facilitate instrumentation. The pericardium was opened and suspended to expose right atrium. Two parallel sutures of approximately 8 to 16 mm in diameter were placed on the anterolateral right atrium, and heparin (1 mg/kg, IV) was administered to maintain an activated clotting time >250 seconds. After the occluder was drawn into the delivery sheath, a 1-cm incision was opened in the right atrium, and the delivery sheath was inserted. The sheath was advanced under continuous TTE guidance, through the ASD into the left atrium. (Fig. 3) The left disc was deployed first by pushing the rod. The sheath was withdrawn as the left disc was adjusted parallel to the atrial septum, and the right disc was deployed on the other side to occlude the ASD. (Fig. 4) The sheath was moved in a to-and-fro motion to ensure a secure position across the defect. The disc position was assessed using TTE to ensure there was no significantly residual shunt, no distortion of the atrioventricular valve, and no obstruction of the venae cavae or coronary sinus. The thread was cut, and the sheath was withdrawn with the suture tied snugly. The chest was closed using routine procedures, and the patient was instructed to take oral dipyridamole or aspirin for three months as an anticoagulant.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 3.

Those with other coexisting cardiac anomalies were excluded from the study. All patients in the study group received intraoperative device closure. The patients ranged in age from 3 months to 62 years (mean ± standard deviation: 20.0±16.8 years) and weighed from 3.5 to 72 kg (mean: 37.6±20.1 kg). Inclusion criteria for intraoperative device closure were the same as those for surgical or transcatheter closure: hemodynamically significant L-R shunts, and/or significant chamber enlargement, and/or mild-to-moderate pulmonary hypertension despite medical therapy or history of infective endocarditis.\nRoutine examinations included a standard electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, and blood tests. Arrhythmias were detected in 17 patients before the operation: complete right bundle branch block (1 patient), incomplete right bundle branch block (1 patien), left anterior hemiblock (1 patient), left bundle branch block (2 patients), Mobitz type I AVB (2 patients), sinus bradycardia (5 patients), premature atrial beats (3 patients), and atrial fibrillation (2 patients)).\n\n\n        Ethics\n      The present study was approved by the ethics committee of our university and was conducted according to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients or their parents.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nContinuous data were presented as mean± standard deviation and range.\n\nDelivery of the occluder was successful in all patients. The size of the ASD as measured by TTE ranged from 5 to 44 mm (mean 20.8±10.8 mm). The size of the implanted occluder ranged from 6 to 48 mm (mean 23.8±11.2 mm). Immediate post-procedure third-degree AVB was observed in two patients. Since their heart rates ranged from about 50–55 beats per minute, no intervention was needed except for close observation of one patient. Another patient recovered sinus rhythm intermittently during the operation and had a temporary pacemaker inserted. The AVB resolved spontaneously in these two patients after about one week of glucocorticoid treatment. Mobitz type II AVB occurred in three patients during the procedure. Two patients developed post-operative cardiac arrest and were successfully resuscitated. One other patient changed to Mobitz type I AVB after three days. New minor transient arrhythmia complications-temporary sinus bradycardia, premature atrial beats, and sinus tachycardia-developed in 32 patients in the course of the device deployment. These conditions were treated easily with drugs or resolved spontaneously. Immediate post-procedural Mobitz type I AVB was observed in one patient, requiring only close observation.In those patients who had a successful attempt, the total follow-up period ranged from six months to five years. Out-patient follow-up was by functional, echocardiographic, and ECG assessment. There were no instances of progressive arrhythmia. To date, none of the patients in the study has developed complete AVB."
