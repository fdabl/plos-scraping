            "fulltext": "IntroductionDiffraction theory can be applied successfully to reduce the noise due to heavy traffic, environmental pollution and industrial growth by means of barriers in heavily built up areas. A barrier should be good attenuator of sound and inexpensive at the same time. Such barriers may have absorbing lining on the surfaces and satisfy impedance boundary conditions as well. The scattering of sound and electromagnetic waves has been studied extensively since the half plane problems were investigated by Poincare [1] and Sommerfeld [2]. Many classical problems related to electromagnetic waves diffraction due to line source and point source have been studied so far. These problems constitute a canonical problem for the GTD (geometrical theory of diffraction). Scattering analysis by metallic tapes on paneled compact range reflectors [3] and the line source diffraction of electromagnetic waves by a perfectly conducting half plane was investigated by Jones [4]. Rawlins [5] then considered line source diffraction by an acoustically penetrable or an electromagnetically dielectric half plane having smaller width as compared to the incident wave length. In continuation to this, diffraction by an absorbent semi-infinite plane having different impedance faces [6] is also examined. Rawlins [7] used Ingard's conditions [8] on the boundaries to discuss scattering of sound waves by a half plane. Later on Rawlins' idea is extended to calculate the diffraction by finite strip [9] and diffraction of spherical acoustic wave from an absorbing plane [10]. A related study of diffraction by a finite airfoil in uniform flow is presented by Jeon et al. [11]. Myers' presented an improved form of impedance boundary conditions [12] which were used in [13], [14] for sound wave diffraction problems.\nDiffraction by strips is a significant and classical subject both in electromagnetic and acoustic wave theory. In specific, scattering from resistive, conductive and impedance strips have been considered by Herman et al. [15], while, Senior has also made an attempt to solve a problem related to resistive strip configuration [16]. Many analytical, numerical or approximate analytical methods have been used to study a single or multiple diffraction patterns from a strip. To name a few for example, geometrical theory of diffraction [17], Kobayashi's potential method [18], [19] spectral iteration technique (SIT) [20], method of successive approximations [21] and the W-H technique [22] have positively been utilized. Some recent advances in the literature are also found on Bessel's potential spaces [23] and Maliuzhinetz-Sommerfeld integral representation [24].\nKeeping in view the aforementioned studies, the major aim of this article is to discuss a wave diffraction problem relating field and its normal derivative as first order impedance conditions which are referred to as standard impedance conditions. These conditions are used as they introduce simplification in calculations to make the problem tractable and to achieve a solution simple enough to use. The impedance conditions can be used effectively for the problems dealing with material surfaces whose solution would be impractical without them. Such conditions are widely used to give analytical solutions to canonical problems. This article provides the comprehensive treatment of impedance boundary conditions applied to electromagnetic. The analytical solutions are amenable to develop high frequency electromagnetic scattering codes and should therefore be of interest to practicing engineers as well as researchers concerned with high frequency diffraction by impedance structures. As mentioned earlier, the finite strip problems have been solved by many researchers who considered different impedance boundary conditions. In the present analysis, the solution to plane wave diffraction by a finite conducting plate with impedance type boundary conditions is produced by the two edges of the finite plate.\nThe structure of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 0, governing problem which is composed of Helmholtz's equation, impedance boundary conditions and continuity conditions, is stated along with its geometrical configuration. The integral transforms are introduced to convert the problem in complex plane so that two unknown functions are defined. The three part boundary value problem is simplified in terms of two Wiener-Hopf functional equations in Section  from which we derive integral equations in Section  using the standard Wiener-Hopf procedure. The procedure is inspired by the book of Noble [22] which is concerned with the application of the Wiener-Hopf technique to the problems involving semi-infinite and finite geometries and discusses a wide range of extensions. In Section , analytic approximation for the two unknown functions are derived using asymptotic analysis of the integral equation for large complex argument. The analytical expressions for separated and interacted fields at both edges are computed. In Section  the amplitude of the separated field (which contributes in a physical situation) versus observation angle is tested graphically while problem is concluded in Section  It is mentioned that the time factor is supposed to be  and neglected throughout the analysis.\nStatement of the Boundary Value ProblemThis section is dedicated to yield the geometric configuration, governing mathematical equation, corresponding boundary conditions and the transformation used to obtain standard Wiener-Hopf functional equations.\nConsider the scattering of a time harmonic, plane wave incidence by an impedance finite plate having specific impedance say . A plate of length    is encountering a small gust with uniform flow  parallel to the finite plate as shown in Figure 1.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.  Geometrical configuration of the problem.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0092566.g001The finite plate is assumed to be infinitely thin and straight.

Different impedance conditions are imposed on upper and lower faces of the conducting plate. Therefore the total diffracted field  (which may be named as diffracted electric field due to a conducting plate) is to be determined with the following boundary and continuity conditions(5)and\n(6)(7)\nThe boundary conditions (5) are the first order impedance conditions relating field and its normal derivative as outlined by Senior et al. [25]. These impedance boundary conditions were subsequently used to model radio waves propagation along the surface of earth and near conducting obstacles. The detail discussion and practical importance of these impedance conditions can be found in [26]. The obstacle (finite conducting plate) occupies   with the velocity of the moving fluid parallel to the axis having magnitude . The fluid flow is considered as uniform flow moving along the plate. The governing equations are linearized and the special effects of viscosity, thermal conductivity and gravity are ignored while the fluid is assumed to have a constant density (incompressible fluid) and sound speed .\nProblem in Transform DomainFor the solution of boundary value problem (4–7), let us introduce Fourier transform with respect to variable  as(8)for  While taking into account the asymptotic behaviors of  for  as\n(9) is a regular function of  in  and  to be regular in  and  to be analytic in the common region  which will provide the analytic region for the use of Wiener-Hopf technique, hence.\n\n(10)\nNow for a plane wave incident on a finite plate,  and the incident field in the transformed domain in the region ,  gives.(11)\nAlso the reflected field  in the transformed domain  is given by.(12)\nThe Fourier transform of Eqs.

            "fulltext": "IntroductionThere is a general consensus that the search for clean sources of energy with no climatic and environmental impact constitutes a major strategic objective at present. In this sense, nanoscale thermal radiation conversion offers a source for intensive clean energy generation. Thermal radiation has always been an active field of study. Throughout the 19th century, great scientists (Boltzmann, Stefan, Rayleigh, etc.) dedicated a considerable effort to this problem which was completely solved at the turn of the 20th century due to Planck's contribution to the founding of quantum mechanics. After this, it seemed to be a well-established fact that the maximum power extracted from a hot body depended on the temperature as .\nHowever, recently, thanks to modern technological advances, it has been shown that energy exchange through thermal radiation at nanometric distances breaks by several orders of magnitude the limits posed by Stefan-Boltzmann law for black body radiation. Moreover, near-field thermal radiation is approximately monochromatic and reveals itself coherent in space and time, which may lead to stationary interference phenomena in a micro-cavity. Therefore, this monochromaticity and coherence along with the overcoming of Stefan-Boltzmann limits, all of these distinguishing features together confer near-field radiation a great potential for future applications in nanotechnology and, as we have said at the beginning, energy conversion as well. Several reviews on this issue have been written recently, see Ref. [1]–[3] by way of example.\nAn ever-increasing number of investigators has marked the recent history of the research on near-field radiation. Polder and van Hove [4] first studied heat transfer between two objects at nanometric scales maintained at different temperatures by following a stochastic or fluctuational electrodynamics formalism established by Rytov et al. [5]. Recently, it has been emphasized [6] that surfaces modes as included in the solution of Maxwell's equations in Ref [4] can greatly enhance the heat flow. Experiments showing that the heat flow at the nanoscale is indeed greater than the blackbody radiation limit among materials supporting surface modes were reported in Ref [7], [8] and between two gold surfaces in Ref [9]. Likewise, Pendry [10] gave a simple derivation of the expression found by Polder and van Hove and some interpretation in terms of heat transfer channels in addition to a discussion of the maximum heat flux. The problem was reformulated by using a Landauer-like approach by Biehs et al. [11]. Finally, Sasihithlu and Narayanaswamy [12] performed a discussion of the proximity approximation. All these approaches have something in common: the linear response regime and, consequently, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT), whose validity is not guaranteed at this level. Thus, an approach based on the contributions of fluctuating dipole effects seems to be the heart of a considerably simplified treatment of energy transfer at the nanoscale [7], [8], [13]. These approaches include a wide range of phenomena in which the energy between molecules is dominated by dipole-dipole interactions, also known as the Förster energy transfer [14].\nNonetheless, as two nanostructures thermalized at different temperatures come closer to each other, the distribution of charges and currents becomes asymmetric and therefore, defies description in terms of dipolar interactions. Hence, it becomes clear that one must bear in mind higher order effects beyond the dipole [14] and also include other contributions to thermal conductance quite common in disordered amorphous materials, leading to a generalization of the FDT mentioned above [16].\nIn this article, we will go deeper into these aspects by showing how phonon-photon coupling effects account for microscale radiative energy transfer by considering non-Debye relaxation due to the excess of modes in the low and high frequencies in the bulk material [15]–[17]. In the current literature on disordered systems, the non-Debye refers to an excess of modes of vibration over the Debye level observed in inelastic light (Raman) and neutron scattering. From here, we obtain a general expression for the heat transfer coefficient including both Debye and non-Debye contributions, providing an overall explanation of the energy transfer through micrometric gaps. The findings of our theory fit existing experimental results with a high degree of accuracy.\nMethodsOur theoretical framework has been described in previous publications [16], [17] and is briefly summarized here. We consider a gas of quanta distributed in phase space according to the probability density , where , , and , with  and  being the momentum and position of a quanta, respectively. Here, we must pay attention to the fact that  possesses dimensions of ,  being Planck's constant. The thermodynamic description that we propose entails the formulation of the second law of thermodynamics, which can be carried out by means of the Gibbs entropy postulate [18],(1)This equation gives us the nonequilibrium entropy of the gas of quanta plus the bath, with  being the equilibrium entropy and  the equilibrium probability density.\nIn general, entropy is produced due to irreversible processes, in such a manner that irreversible processes in nonequilibrium systems are described by means of currents, thermodynamic forces (affinities), and the entropy production rate, which is always positive. It is precisely this positive character of the entropy production that enables us to derive relaxation equations. Since the probability density is conserved the existence of a density gradient  yields a current  which unleashes a relaxation process . In addition, this current satisfies the relation , derived from the entropy production, which can be obtained from Eq. (1) [16], [18]. Here,  is a material-dependent quantity, the matrix of diffusion coefficients, satisfying Onsager's symmetry principle. In general, due to the tensorial character of the diffusion matrix, both currents  and  are coupled(2)where  are the diffusion matrix components.\nThe main contribution of this article is to apply this formalism to the description of the radiative heat transfer between a nanosphere and a plate at different temperatures,  (hot) and  (cold), separated by a distance  (see Fig. 1). We assume that heat transfer results from two different mechanisms. (I) On one hand, we consider a conventional radiative heat exchange involving the dynamics of quasiparticles as the result of two simultaneous processes: elastic emission and absorption of hot photons from the medium at  and elastic emission and absorption of cold photons from the medium at ; these processes also involve the presence of surface modes [6], [10]. (II) The second mechanism behind heat transfer has to do with the excitation of coupled resonant modes from the collection of acoustic states related to defective soft structures in a disordered regime [19]–[21]. This process encompasses inelastic scattering of the impinging radiation, which is linked to nonequilibrium contributions. In both scenarios, there is no diffusion in configuration space since quanta are massless particles [16], and as a consequence , which brings about . Hence, from Eq. (2) one obtains the appropriate diffusion current in momentum space(3)where  is the relaxation time, which depends on the diffusion matrix components.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.  Schematic diagram of the radiation exchanged via conventional radiative transfer.Elastic collision of photons with atoms or molecules of materials and phonon-photon coupling contributions between a sphere and a plate maintained at different temperatures,  and , separated by a distance .\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0058770.g001\nNear-field analysis\nIn the near-field regime, confinement of the electromagnetic waves in a micrometric gap separating neighboring nanostructures introduces peculiar effects in the spectrum of the thermal radiation. Here is where the collective modes (phonons) excited in the material by the impinging radiation come into play. To discern whether confinement effects are important or absent we shall assume a cut-off wavelength, the thermal wavelength of a photon , which is proportional to the Wien's displacement law through a proportionality constant, i.e. , where here . Actually, when  we have a blackbody spectrum of radiation. One may wonder what happens when . Since according to Heisenberg's principle , assuming that the maximum value of  is , one obtains , and thus the minimum value of  is , leading to , with . Here,  is, precisely, the inverse of the refractive index. Hence, not all frequencies are possible and the frequency of resonance  appears.\nIn these circumstances, integrating by parts the resultant continuity equation gives us(4)with , where we have assumed that  at . Performing a second integration of Eq. (3) through from 1 to 2, we find the net current(5)where  is related to the population of quasiparticles at  and . Moreover, , with  corresponding to a hierarchy of relaxation times ubiquitous in complex systems.\nIn the stationary state, once the system has thermalized at temperatures  and , ; the factor  comes from the polarization of a photon and  being the averaged number of quasiparticles in a elementary cell of volume  of the phase-space given by Planck's distribution [22], . Besides, ; therefore leading to a stationary value, i.e. . Thus, the heat flow  can be obtained from the sum of all the contributions as(6)where , with  being the unit vector in the direction of , and the distribution of frequencies is given by(7)\nAt this point, it is worthwhile to make a short digression about the physical meaning of the time scale . It has been known for a long time [23] that for most condensed systems in time-dependent fields, the orientation polarization behavior can, as a good approximation, be characterized by a relaxation time distribution (); this behavior is generally meant as dielectric relaxation. In harmonic fields, this implies that the complex dielectric permittivity in the frequency range corresponding to the characteristic times for the molecular reorientation can be written as(8)where  is the static dielectric constant and  is the permittivity at the infinite frequency. Here, the relaxation time distribution  satisfies the normalization condition,  and Eq. (8) constitutes a generalization of the Debye treatment based on Clausius-Mossotti equation [24](9)This Debye's equation, Eq. (9), follows after Fourier-transforming the relaxation function  which coincides with the normalized dielectric function . Note that if we assume a time-independent time scale  in Eq. (5), after integration we shall obtain the Debye relaxation function in terms of . Hence, we can understand  as defined through the relation(10)which shows that the Callen-Welton FDT [25] is not valid at this level. In fact, unlike here, the FDT is related to decaying equilibrium fluctuations characterized, precisely, by a single relaxation time.\nNow, let's return to the main topic after that brief digression. Note that according to Eq. (6), in the limit ,(11)giving us the blackbody radiation limit provided , . On the other hand, in the limit ,  which in contrast to the descriptions based on evanescent surface waves avoids divergences in the heat flux in a self-consistent way. Nonetheless, for finite  we can rephrase the expression of the heat current given by Eq. (6) introducing a new varible (12)where the mean value theorem has been used to approximate the integral, with . Hence, since , Eq. (12) reduces to(13)In terms of Planck's distribution, Eq. (13) can be rewritten(14)while  must be determined in a more general way, by scrutinizing the interaction processes between light and bulk material.\nFor first order in the temperature difference ,(15)with , and . Thus, it follows that the heat transfer coefficient, the quantity usually measured in experiments and defined by , is given through(16)\nWhen the mechanism of heat exchange is through elastic collisions, which is similar to Rayleigh scattering, it is known that the intensity of radiation is proportional to  [26]. Therefore,(17)where the time scale  is a material-dependent parameter. On the other hand, regarding the inelastic contribution to the near-field heat exchange, this is the analogue to the Raman scattering of light. In this case, the distribution of modes presents anomalies which result from states located at a lower energy region [21]. The Raman spectra is fitted using a lognormal function first proposed by Denisov and Rylev [19]. This lognormal distribution is a statistical model, which can describe collective motions causing extremely slow structural relaxation, thereby fitting the non-Debye anomalies [27]. Therefore, this accounts for the high nonlinear behavior of the thermal conductance between both materials. For the proposed case, we assume that the density of vibrational states is achieved through the use of a lognormal distribution, which corresponds to(18)Here,  (characteristic frequency) and  (standard deviation) are two fitting parameters characterizing the lognormal distribution. The lognormal in Eq. (18) stems from the existence of a hierarchy of relaxation mechanisms in the material, related to the presence of collective effects. This distribution, results from the fact that the energy of the system consists of a large number of contributions and the application of the central limit theorem of probability theory (see Appendix S1). In view of the properties of the lognormal distribution, it must be noticed that(19)being a kind of closure relation for the relaxation times.\nHence, the excitation of a mode constitutes a photoinduced cooperative phenomenon. It is plausible to assume that the cumulative effect of incident photons ends perturbing the material, thus triggering collective oscillations. In addition, the lognormal accounts for an excess of ways of adsorbing energy by the system with respect to the ways obtained when merely the Debye squared-frequency law describes the relaxation. Therefore, this provides a reasonable description of the non-Debye law [20], [21], which as in Raman scattering also becomes manifests in radiation problems.\nAccordingly, the heat transfer coefficient, Eq. (16), results from the addition of the elastic and inelastic contributions mentioned above(20)where  and . In Eq. (20), the first term inside the square brackets corresponds to the usual contributions found up to now in the current literature [6], taking into account surface phonon-polaritons owing to the presence of evanescent waves close to the interface. As we have mentioned above, the second term takes into account cooperative phenomena, becoming manifest through the existence of collective modes of vibration in the system, which appear in the density of states. Consequently, a more general formulation for the radiative heat transfer problems must come from the superposition of Debye and non-Debye relaxation mechanisms, combining in this way the contributions from the material surfaces as well as the bulk.\n\nResults and DiscussionThe thermal conductance is obtained by integrating the heat transfer coefficient over the surface of a sphere of radius  divided by its area (), i.e. . Since the distance  between both surfaces depends on geometrical characteristics, the local distance between the sphere and the plane surface must be measured through the local radius , assuming the effective distance as , with  being a surface roughness parameter [7].\nWe have calculated numerically the surface average by adjusting the parameters mentioned above to the experimental results obtained in the Ref [9], which takes into account only the near-field contribution when decreasing the sphere-plate distance. In Fig. 2, we show the near-field conductance fitting the values of the integral of Eq. (20) to the data for glass-glass [8] and gold-gold materials [9]. For both the material we have used  Hz,  Hz, and . For the glass-glass material we have obtained  and for gold-gold . The near-field heat transfer described using evanescent waves as solutions of classical electrodynamics equations leads to heat flux divergences as the gap vanishes [28]. However, in our approach this divergence does not occur, reaching a constant-conductance value as the distance between the nanoparticles decreases (shown in the inset). In essence, this is due to the fact that the time relaxation distribution herein described by lognormal distribution incorporates two effects: (I) Phonon branches in a real structure affecting the density of states in different frequency regions, similar to actual behavior observed in metals [29]; and (II) the vibrational modes in the bulk material absorbing the energy excess. Hence, since our assumption of a distribution of relaxation times accurately describes the dynamics of radiative systems at the microscale, we conclude that the FDT in the Callen-Welton formulation [25] is not applicable at the nanoscale and must be modified. By going beyond the Debye theory, a way for this generalization is offered here.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 2.

Although near-field radiative transfer is a highly complex phenomenon, we have been able to provide a unified and highly accurate explanation of heat exchange processes at the nanoscale. Our theory covers all distances from the far-field up to contact. Since the experiments examined may involve a great variety of nanostructures, our theory possesses a wide scope of applications. The general methodology presented here may also be used in the study of other heat exchange processes such as those occurring in phonon systems and in the analysis of thermal contributions to Casimir forces, even in charge conduction problems in nanosystems.\n\nAppendix S1.

            "fulltext": "IntroductionRecently it has been claimed in scientific literature that it is possible to generate radio waves, at a single frequency, with more spatially orthogonal modes, “orbital modes”, than the usual two polarization modes [1]–[4]. An experimental demonstration with N = 2 modes purporting to confirm the twisted wave concept has been carried out and published [2]. Such radio waves would have angular momenta, also referred to as orbital angular momenta, in a way similar to the orthogonal (l) wave modes of electrons that exist at the same frequency and belong to the same main quantum number (n). Communication utilizing such independent/orthogonal modes would expand the available frequency band by a factor given by the number of additional spatially orthogonal modes. Because the information channel capacity of radio waves scales linearly with the number of spatially orthogonal modes N, in the case of fixed bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio if N can be more than two or even infinite as claimed [1], wireless communication would be revolutionized.\nIt is important to note that recently two independent groups published papers [5], [6] concluding that the proposed twisted wave schemes are a special case of the traditional multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technique and are thus not conceptually new. Furthermore [5] points out that in the far field the twisted wave scheme does not provide any increase in information channel capacity. Paper [6] shows that the experiments [2] have not been performed in “far-enough-field” conditions. A true far field wireless experiment would show further losses and other deficiencies in individual twisted wave modes [5].\nResults and DiscussionIn this paper we address a fundamental physics question: Can modes with non-zero angular momenta representing extra, beyond N = 2, independent communication channels be radiated to the far field and selectively picked up by a proper antenna, which is insensitive to standard plane wave modes? If the polarization is circular–a common situation in wireless technology–one has N = 2 with plane waves in the two polarization modes phase-shifted by 90°. Thus it is clear that up to N = 2 orthogonal plane wave polarization modes can exist in the far field and the circularly polarized mode carries angular momentum. Yet to date whether a greater number of angular momentum modes can exist at the same frequency and carrying independent signals in the far field has not been shown to violate fundamental physical principles.\nIt should first be noted that based on physical principles the assumption that there can be more than the two far-field polarization modes is counter-intuitive. In the atom, the existence of waves with different angular momenta at the same energy originates from the potential and the ensuing localized nature of the waves. A charge revolving in a Coulomb potential field will have an infinite number of different classical physical paths with the same energy, and Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization will select a finite number of states that are allowed within quantum theory. But, in stark contrast no such state components exist for free electron waves. In light of this intuitive argument, the existence of spatially orthogonal modes for electromagnetic waves is fine for photons propagating under spatially confined conditions such as in wave guides and optical fibers [7], [8], or in the immediate surroundings of a black hole [9]. We reiterate that the existing experimental radio wave demonstrations [2] hold only for .\nRather than analyzing the theoretical treatments for errors, we use another approach to prove that the hypothesis that independent communication channels based on orbital modes can be selectively picked up by a proper antenna that is insensitive to standard plane wave modes violates the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which states that it is impossible to construct a perpetual motion machine of the second kind. First let us specify the necessary conditions that are essential for the utilization of the M-th orbital mode as a parallel independent information channel:\n\n\n\n\nA selective antenna must exist that is able to radiate in the M-th orbital mode.\n\nThe same antenna should selectively pick up a signal from an electromagnetic wave only at the M-th orbital mode while discarding all the other orbital and non-orbital mode components in that signal.\n\nAccording to Planck’s Law [10], the a black-body (with unity emissivity) radiates in each polarization with a power spectral intensity(1)where f is frequency,  Js is Planck’s constant,  JK–1 is Boltzmann’s constant and T is absolute temperature. This means that a unit surface area of the black-body emits, in each polarization, the power(2)within an infinitesimally small frequency band around . Thus the total radiated power from a unit area is(3)where N = 2 is the number of orthogonal polarization modes. Thus the Planck formula [10], is:\n(4)Inspired by Nyquist’s treatment of Johnson noise [11], we now devise the following gedanken experiment, see Figure 1: A large box (much larger than the wavelengths considered) is located in a thermal reservoir of temperature T. We assume that its internal walls are ideally black. Furthermore an isolated resistor (with radiation screening and thermal isolation) and a “twisted-wave” antenna tuned to the M-th orbital mode in a bandwidth of  around frequency f are in the box and the resistor is connected to the electrodes of the antenna. We start from thermal equilibrium, i.e., a uniform temperature within the box, including the walls, the inherent thermal radiation, the antenna, the resistor, and the thermal isolation/screening.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.  Outline of the gedanken experiment.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0056086.g001Conditions i) and ii) will result in the following situation:\n\n\n\n\nIn accordance with condition i), the energy supplied by the resistor will be radiated by the antenna in the M-th orbital wave mode. This energy will be absorbed in the walls. The wall will emit thermal radiation in the form of plane waves [10] with a power given by Eq. 4.\n\nIn accordance with condition ii), the antenna can pick up a signal only at the M-th orbital mode while it will discard all plane wave components radiated by the walls of the box. This means that the antenna will not pick up any signal because the walls emit only plane waves [10].\n\nThus the energy will flow out from the resistor and cannot return. Therefore Boltzmann’s Principle of Detailed Balance [12] cannot be satisfied. The resistor cools down, which implies that a temperature inhomogeneity is induced in the system in thermal equilibrium and hence the Second Law of Thermodynamics is violated. The only way to avoid violation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics with the above set-up is to suppose that the antenna also picks up plane wave modes. However, in that case the antenna cannot offer a separate information channel for the orbital mode.\nIt should also be mentioned that it is well-known that corresponding antenna types that can emit circularly polarized waves (which also have non-zero angular momentum) are sensitive to plane waves because a plane wave will excite its relevant polarization mode. Thus a circularly polarized antenna will not violate the Second Law when it is used in the same gedanken experiment as described above.\nMethods and ConclusionsWe have presented and analyzed a gedanken experiment with a black body and a twisted-wave antenna in thermal equilibrium. We have shown that the assumption that at a single frequency more than two independent information channels can be provided by an antenna violates the Second Law of Thermodynamics. In conclusion, twisted waves cannot carry information that is independent from the information contained in plane wave modes at the same frequency.\n"

            "fulltext": "IntroductionThermoacoustic instabilities result from the uncontrolled amplification of acoustic waves during combustion. These instabilities are more apparent in combustion systems operating on a lean premixed air fuel ratio, and several mechanisms for the instability have been identified (i.e. [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]). Although combustion systems are normally designed for steady state conditions, some regions of the operating envelope may be prone to the growth of instabilities arising from small initial disturbances. Although these disturbances consume only a very small part of the available energy in the chamber, large pressure oscillations may follow, leading to structural vibrations and—in extreme cases—- “equipment failure” [9].\nThe noise arising from unsteady combustion is commonly expressed in terms of a thermoacoustic Efficiency (TAE), defined asTypical values of the TAE for turbulent flames are  and for laminar flame are  [3], [10], [11]. Instabilities occur for thermoacoustic efficiencies of  [10]; for every order of magnitude change in the TAE, the sound pressure level (SPL) changes by about 10 dB [11].\nA small acoustic wave propagating through the flame may be altered either in amplitude or frequency and this may effect the combustion dynamics. The direct influence of acoustic wave propagation on reaction rates to our knowledge has not been discussed in the literature separately. However, the effect of a wave propagating through a non-equilibrium background has been discussed by numerous authors. Einstein (cited in [12]) and Clarke & McChesney [13] suggest that wave attenuation may occur in dissociating mixtures when the wave itself drives the non-equilibrium component of the flow. Elaine et al. [12] describe how frequency dispersion emerges when a sound wave alters its shape while propagating through a non-equilibrium background. Furthermore, they suggest that acoustic wave amplification is expected only if the non-equilibrium flow already exists in the background, or is caused by an external source and not by the propagating wave itself. Clarke [14] has shown that the non-equilibrium background flow can indeed amplify the acoustic wave . Experimental work by Toong et al. [15] has shown evidence of both the amplification and the suppression of sound waves when they interact with a flame, although these observations are based upon a diffusion flame. Similar conclusions have also been drawn by Melvin [16], Srinivasan & Vincenti [17], and Bauer & Bass [18].\nThe focus of this paper is, therefore, to study the response of a premixed laminar methane flame to small acoustic disturbances and to identify which—if any—acoustic modes induce positive feedback in the pressure oscillations. The novelty of the work comes from the relative complexity of the reaction mechanism employed (18 species and 68 individual reaction steps), and the configuration studied (Low Mach number flow, with fully non-reflective inlet and outlet boundary conditions).\nSection provides a review of flame-acoustic interaction and reaction rate chemistry. The governing equations, discretization schemes and boundary condition treatment for reacting flows are given in section 0.3, along with a brief description of the code used. Results of the simulations are presented in section 2, and conclusions are presented in section 0.6.3.\nAcoustic Waves and Reaction RatesA generalized inhomogeneous wave equation can be derived to describe the relationship between the pressure and heat release fluctuations in an acoustically active field such as a combustion chamber. In the combustion chamber, the source of heat release is solely due to the chemical reactions between oxidizer and fuel. Any acoustic perturbation in the combustion chamber will interact with the flame and may modify the flame structure substantially [19]. Sound generation due to heat release has been reviewed by Higging, Sondhauss and Rijke; an account of their work is given in [20]. Numerous authors (i.e. Putnam and Dennis [21], Shimmer and Vortmeijer [22]) have undertaken experimental studies to investigate flame-acoustic interactions. Putnam et al. [21] have also provided a mathematical formulation for the development of these acoustic instabilities .\nThe generation of acoustic waves in a flame may be due to a natural mode of system, the addition of energy by an external source or by chemical reactions within the system [12]. An order of magnitude analysis of a turbulent reacting mixture shows that heat release fluctuations driven by the species reaction rates  provide the dominant sources [23]. The inhomogeneous acoustic wave equation governing reacting flows involving N chemical species can be expressed in the following form [23], [12]:(1)where  is the pressure fluctuation,   and  is the species enthalpy, defined aswith  taking the value of the reference state enthalpy.  here is an integration variable. The reaction rate for species  is derived by considering I elementary reactions between N species;(2) and  are the stoichiometric coefficients for species  during reaction step , and  represents the chemical species.  is then given bywith(3)The term  represents the collision frequency and is often known as the frequency factor or pre-exponential factor, E is activation energy [24].

This may be specified explicitly as part of the reaction mechanism, or derived via equilibrium considerations.\nSimulationTo study the effect of acoustic waves on flame chemistry, a number of simulations have been carried out using an in-house code. The code is based around a fully compressible solver and was initially developed to study multidimensional reacting flows with arbitrarily complex reaction mechanisms. For the purposes of this work, the problem is specified as one dimensional. Explicit 4th order spatial differencing was employed to calculate the derivatives appearing in the transport equations, while time integration was handled via the low storage 3rd order Runge Kutta scheme proposed by Wray [26]. Prior to this study, the code has been validated against a number of test problems, as recommended by Roache [27], and has been used in a number of other test cases.\n\n0.1 The governing equations\nThe governing equations for a compressible viscous reacting flow can be written in the following form:Where tensor indices i,k = 1,2,3. The transport equations are closed via the thermal equation of state, and the stagnation energy relation [28]The viscous stress tensor is defined asand , , , ,  are the density, momentum, total energy, pressure and characteristic gas constant, respectively. The effects of gravity and radiative heat transfer are assumed to be negligible [29], [30]. The heat flux  is given byLewis and Prandtl numbers are considered constant in this study [29], [30]. Therefore the mass diffuivities  of each species and viscosity are derived via assumption of constant Lewis and Prandtl numbers using following expressions:The value for  is obtained using the CHEMKIN thermodynamic database for the constituent specific heat capacities  [31], and the thermal conductivity is assumed to be given by(4)\n\n\n0.2 Boundary conditions\nBoundary conditions for flows within a finite domain (i.e. closed ducts) are relatively straightforward to treat. In the case where the flow domain is infinite and unbounded, a truncation of the physical domain is desirable for a numerical solution, but such a truncation requires an artificial boundary. Since the focus of our study is to investigate the behaviour of acoustic waves passing through a flame, and since any reflection from the inlet or outlet boundaries may produce spurious effects, we use non reflecting boundary conditions based upon the method of characteristics.\nThe method of characteristics describes how systems of hyperbolic equations can be decomposed into sets of wave modes, each with a definite velocity [32]. At each boundary of the computational domain, some waves enter the domain and some waves leave the domain. The outgoing waves are entirely defined by the interior solution. The incoming waves depend on the exterior solution and require a boundary condition. Thompson [32] gives a complete mathematical analysis and describes the incoming and outgoing waves in a primitive variable form for the Euler equations. This approach has been extended by Poinsot and Lele [33] for the application of non-reflecting boundary conditions to the Navier-Stokes Equations. This approach is commonly referred to as the Navier–Stoke Characteristics Boundary Conditions (NSCBC) approach. An application of this method to reacting flows was initially proposed by Baum et al. [28] and later extended by Sutherland and Kennedy [34].\nFurther refinements to the NSCBC approach have been proposed by Prosser [35], who used a two-scale low Mach number expansion [36] to identify a linearization based around a divergence free state for cold flows. These have been extended to include conducting and reacting flows [37]. For the boundary conditions used in this study, we effectively set(5)where the sign depends on the boundary under consideration,  is the sound speed based on the far field base-state and  is the acoustic divergence, defined as [37]Equation 5 thus specifies an inflow boundary condition which is fixed, modulo the passage of acoustic transients. Details regarding development and implmentation of NSCBC for reacting flows can be seen elsewhere [33], [35], [37], [32]\n\n\n0.3 Discretization schemes, chemistry, and boundary conditions\nA one dimensional domain of length  is discretized using 1024 nodes, resulting in a grid spacing of  The reaction zone (flame thickness) is approximately 4 mm long. An explicit 4th order finite difference method is used for the spatial discretization of the continuity, momentum, energy and species transport equations [38]\nA methane mechanism comprising 68 reaction steps and 18 species is used for the source terms in the species transport equations. The specific heat capacities, enthalpy and entropy are calculated using the polynomial coefficients of the CHEMKIN thermo chemical tables [31]. The simulation is initiated using assumed profiles for key species, and then allowing the calculation to proceed until all of the dependent variables have approached a steady state. By setting the inlet mass flow rate equal to the consumption rate, a stationary flame solution is achieved; this is used as the initial condition for the acoustically active simulation. All simulations are performed assuming an equivalence ration  The pressure and temperature profiles of the steady state solution are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The equilibrium flame temperature is approximately 2200 K, and the flame speed is calculated to be 0.32 m/s\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.

The coupling between the chemistry and the acoustics can manifest itself in one of two waysFrom the flame's perspective, low frequency waves induce negligibly small pressure gradients on the length scales associated with the reaction zone. In such cases, it is extremely unlikely that lighter species could be preferentially displaced with reference to the heavier species. Hence, we have selected relatively high frequency ranges, up to the point where the acoustic wavelength is of the same order as the flame itself; typically, this is around 90 kHz. These latter frequencies are beyond those typically encountered in industrial applications; our interest in them here stems from the fundamental physics.The presence of the flame in the domain acts almost as a discontinuity in the flow due to the sudden changes in density, temperature and subsequently the sound speed. According to acoustic theory [39], when a wave crosses an interface between two different media, some acoustic energy is reflected. In reacting flows, the density of the flow before and after the flame varies significantly. Therefore the acoustic wave passing through a flame resembles a wave crossing an interface between two different media. Figure 3 shows the piecewise continuous acoustic perturbationwhere A is again the maximum perturbation amplitude,  is the Heaviside function, and  is the angular frequency (set to give  in this example).We observe that the acoustic wave is partially reflected when it hits the flame as shown in Figure 4. The reflection of the wave depends upon the product of density and sound speed in the media via the acoustic impedance [39]. The relation between the reflected and incident waves is established by the reflection coefficient, given by [39]:(7)where the 0 and  subscripts refer to the hot and cold sides of the flame, respectively. If the amplitudes of incident, transmitted and reflected waves are I, T and R, respectively, we can write(8)(9)The above relationships are derived for two media with different speeds of sound and density. The results of our simulation have shown that the amplitude of the reflected and transmitted waves are in agreement with analytical calculations obtained from Equations 8 and 9. The single wave simulation was performed for a simulation time of  sec, corresponding to 1.304 acoustic transit times (based on the cold flow variables) to observe attenuation or amplification in the transmitted and reflected waves. Figures 5(a)–(d) show the waves at different time intervals, and we observe that both waves travel smoothly out of the domain without any further change to amplitude or frequency. The nonreflecting character of the inlet and outlet boundaries is evident in figures 5(a)–(d); Separate tests have demonstrated that the reflection coefficients for this boundary condition is  for physical waves, and  for numerical waves [35].The amplitudes of the reflected wave and the transmitted wave are approximately  and , respectively, as shown in the figure 4. We define relative errors in the incident and reflected waves asThe subscripts  and  refer to the numerical and analytic result, respectively. We find that for our simulations,  with a similar figure for  Rather than be a product of a non-linear phenomenon, this figure is more likely a result of the manner in which the amplitudes are measured—the wave peak almost never exactly collocates on a grid point, and so there is a small phase error induced in estimating the peak amplitude. Notwithstanding the foregoing argument, the error is small and the essential constancy of  leads us to conclude that the acoustic wave has been neither amplified nor attenuated during its transit of the nonequilibrium region of the flow. This test has been repeated a number of times with different amplitudes and frequencies. The results were the same as those reported here.To study the effect of pressure waves on combustion chemistry, we have examined the response of the heat release, the reaction rate and the burning velocity to a number of imposed frequencies. Instantaneous integral values of reaction rate are obtained by integrating  for a particular species over the domain length at each time step. Similarly the integral values of burning velocity and heat release are calculated. Figures 6, 7 and 8 show the time history of the relative change of the integral values of reaction rate of , heat release and burning velocities respectively. The relative change is calculated using the following expressions:(10)(11)(12)where the suffix  is used to refer to an acoustically quiescent benchmark solution i.e. no acoustic wave passing through the flame, and additionally  is a constant,  depends on which species you choose)c and h refer to the cold and hot sides of the flame, respectively.The relative changes in reaction rate, heat release and burning velocities are very small. A small perturbation in the integral values of heat release and burning velocities is also visible in figures 7 and 8 during initial stages ( sec), which shows the effect on integral values when the wave is crossing the inlet boundaries. As the density and pressure are related through the equation of state, any fluctuation in pressure will also produce a fluctuation in the density. Consequently a fluctuation in the conservative form of species mass fraction  at the inlet will effect the integral values. This initial perturbation disappears once the wave has crossed the inlet (i.e. after  sec).The perturbation in reaction rate and burning velocities are essentially instantaneous when the wave passes through the flame. However, a time delay can be seen in the heat release, which is due to the time scales related to the chemical reaction. Although the study of a single wave did not provide any direct effect of combustion on the amplification or attenuation of the acoustic wave, the perturbations in these three parameters may feed some energy to the subsequent acoustic waves.In this section, we extend our study to that of a high frequency wave train propagating through the flame structure. The purpose of this test is to identify additional effects arising from the coupling of the incoming waves to the flame, such as (say) standing waves local to the reaction zone. The simulation is run for a sufficient time  to ensure that at least 3 waves have crossed the flame thickness. Low frequency acoustic waves produce only negligibly small differential pressure gradients across the flame; such waves are felt by the flame essentially as a uniform background pressure oscillation. It is difficult to see how such a bulk effect could give rise to significant changes in the flame structure. Consequently, we restrict our attention to comparatively high frequencies: 3 kHz, 5 kHz, 8 kHz and 10 kHz are chosen. In order to study the sensitivity of the flame to both amplitude and frequency, each frequency is simulated for three different pressure perturbations of amplitudes ,  and  corresponding to sound pressure levels of 140 dB, 168 dB and 180 dB, respectively.Figures 9 and 10 show the dependences on pressure of the burning velocity and heat release on the pressure.The reaction rate integrals of  and  are shown in figures 11 and 12. It can be seen that the relative change in the reaction rate of  (and hence its integral) is larger than that associated with . The relative change in the reaction rates of a number of other species is also shown in figure 13. Although the relative change in the  and  is moderate, the net effect of these species in terms of the heat release is very small.The relative changes in burning velocity and heat release for  perturbations imposed at different frequencies are shown in figures 14 and 15, respectively. Interestingly, both quantities exhibit a frequency dependence, with their peak values increasing with increasing frequency. This effect appears to result from a change in the flame structure. Evidence for this observation comes from figures 16 and 17 which, between them show different sensitivities on the  and  production rates. Additionally, figure 18 depicts the maximum change in production of a number of other species, with respect to the incident wave frequency. This figure shows that there exists no simple relation between the molecular weight of a species and its relative change. The  and  curves, for example share very similar molecular weights, but exhibit very different behaviours with respect to imposed frequency. We conclude from this that the change in flame speed cannot result simply from the pressure gradient acting preferentially on the light species.In the foregoing parts of the paper, the flame thickness is small compared to the incident acoustic wavelength (i.e. a  wave has a wavelength  times greater than the simulated flame thickness of approximately ). In such cases the effect of the pressure wave will produce very small pressure gradients across the flame. To obtain a more realistic measure of the pressure fluctuation on the flame, we have extended the range of high frequencies to ensure a more comparable relation between flame thickness and wavelength.Following McIntosh [40], we define the ratios of time and lengthscale for flame-acoustic interaction as:(13)(14)Using the Mach number  Based on the flame speed, both time and length scales can be related as [40]:(15)For a harmonic wave, the disturbance length is taken as half of the wavelength: for  (say) the disturbance length is  based upon the initial sound speed in the fuel/air mixture of . The parameter  is critical in establishing the flame-acoustic interaction. Strong pressure effects on flame/acoustic configurations with small  arise as a result of sharp pressure gradients across the flame [41]. McIntosh [42] has also observed that the effect of pressure gradients will be more important when  and .We have adopted an alternate form to define the acoustic time scale ratio  in terms of frequency:The above expression shows a direct relation to frequency of the incident wave. In our analysis of high frequencies, we have found that the effect of pressure perturbations increases when N is decreased. The relative change is a maximum when N reaches unity. Figure 19 and 20 depict the maximum values of  with pressure perturbations of  and . Pressure perturbations of  do not appear to have a significant effect on the flame speed perturbation. This is in marked contrast to the  case, for which there exists a marked peak for  (corresponding approximately to ). This lends further strength to the notion that acoustic influences are not restricted just to preferential acceleration of the light species; the pressure gradients seen by a flame are the same for a wave of amplitude p and frequency f as they are for a wave of amplitude  and frequency —yet the figures show no such correspondence in their profiles. Hence, it appears that the pointwise value of pressure (as well as its gradient) is important to the flame. This is ostensibly a surprising result, since a  perturbation only corresponds to  os the total pressure the flame sees. Nevertheless, this figure is approximately consistent with the flame speed changes observed. For oscillations of  we see that a peak change is near , and a downward trend is observed for . This shows that for a value of , the effect of the pressure amplitude becomes less significant.We have not studied further frequencies beyond 120 kHz because these frequencies are not often found (i.e. ) in practical applications. Although large fluctuations may result in extinction and re-ignition of the flame, the relative change in the burning velocities in our simulations is not substantial for the range of pressure fluctuations studied."

Although theory predicts that these flows will generate sound, the prevailing view has been that black smokers are essentially silent. Here we present the first unambiguous field recordings showing that these vents radiate significant acoustic energy. The sounds contain a broadband component and narrowband tones which are indicative of resonance. The amplitude of the broadband component shows tidal modulation which is indicative of discharge rate variations related to the mechanics of tidal loading.

            "fulltext": "IntroductionMid-Ocean ridge hydrothermal systems support rich communities of chemosynthetic organisms and are conduits for large heat and chemical exchanges between young oceanic lithosphere and the ocean. On a global scale the time-averaged hydrothermal heat flux and many chemical fluxes are well constrained [1]. On local scales these fluxes are temporally and spatially variable [2]–[4], but the variations are poorly quantified because there are few time-series measurements of fluid flow with which to integrate temperature and chemical observations. While time-series measurements of flow have been obtained in low-temperature vents [4], [5], and point measurements have been obtained in black smokers [6], [7], no time-series measurements of black smoker flow exist. High temperatures, low pH, and mineral precipitation limit the long-term effectiveness of invasive flow measurement techniques commonly employed in these environments.\nThe development of a non-invasive flow measurement technique could solve this problem and enable the collection of extended time-series flow data. One proposed method [8] would use passive acoustic measurements and capitalize on the potential for fluid flow to produce sound [9]. Passive acoustic measurements near black smokers could provide flow rate information if flow-related sounds can be detected, and if a relationship between flow rate and acoustics can be established. Point measurements of flow using an invasive measurement technique [6] could be used to convert time-series measurements of acoustically-determined relative flow rates into absolute measurements.\nWhile previous studies have noted an apparent increase in ambient noise within several hundred meters of two hydrothermal vent sites [10], [11], another study found no conclusive evidence that hydrothermal vents generate sound [8]. In this report we present the first detailed description of the localized sound generation by two mid-ocean ridge black smoker hydrothermal vents. We discuss the likely sound source mechanisms that operate to produce both broadband and narrowband signals. We then discuss the tidal variations observed in one record, which we argue is related to tidal forces affecting fluid circulation within the hydrothermal system. We conclude with speculation on the biological implications of black smoker sound production.\nResultsUsing a stand-alone deep-sea digital acoustic recording system, we recorded 45 hours of continuous sound sampled at 1000 Hz in 2004, and 136 hours of continuous sound sampled at 1920 Hz in 2005, from the “Sully” and “Puffer” vents respectively (Figure 1). These two vents are situated approximately 2200 m below the sea surface, within the Main Endeavour vent field on the Juan de Fuca Ridge. We also recorded the local ambient noise field at a distance of ~150 m from the nearest black smoker in 2004, and ~25 m from the nearest black smoker in 2005.

Both vents generate a broadband acoustic signal with power levels ~10–30 dB above the ambient noise level. Both vents also produce numerous narrowband tones at frequencies ranging from ~10–250 Hz, with power levels ~10–20 dB above the broadband signal level and bandwidths of ~5–15 Hz.

The general shape of the spectrum remains relatively constant, but some fine-scale features vary.

Overlain on an arbitrary scale in the lower panel is the predicted tidal height for the study area [44]. The peak-to-peak tidal amplitude is ~2 m. Tidal variability is discernible between ~200–250 Hz for this choice of color scales. The very narrow peak at 360 Hz is associated with a nearby research vessel.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0000133.g004Tidal variability is also evident in the acoustic record of Puffer. A comparison of the predicted tidal heights with the spectrogram (Figure 4) hints at this variability. For the choice of color scales in this figure, the power levels within the ~200–250 Hz band appear elevated after high tide. A spectral analysis of the power in different frequency bands reveals that the acoustic signals contain semi-diurnal periodicity within the ~150–325 Hz and ~450–500 Hz bands (Figure 5). The ~1.95 cycles per day signal corresponds closely to the 1.93 cycles per day frequency of the 12.42-h M2 tidal component [12]. Cross correlation of the tidal signal with the time-series of power level in these frequency bands shows that maximal acoustic output lags the M2 tidal component by ~115–127° (Figure 6). This is equivalent to a lag of ~238–262 minutes with respect to high tide.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 5.

The presence of both broadband and narrowband components in the acoustic signals indicate that multiple mechanisms are operating within Sully and Puffer. Potential broadband sources include boiling, cavitation, turbulent shear, advected fluid heterogeneity, pulsating exit flow, fluid–structure interactions, and volume changes associated with the cooling of hydrothermal fluid. Many of these source mechanisms were discussed in the context of black smoker systems in [8]. Here we review some of this work in light of our results.\nSound source mechanisms are typically divided into three separate classes of acoustic radiators: monopoles, dipoles, and quadrupoles. Each of these source types has a different near-field radiation pattern, where the near-field is defined as the region within one acoustic wavelength of the sound source [8]. Monopoles radiate sound through volume or mass fluctuations, and have one-dimensional pressure fields. This type of acoustic radiation would be generated by a sphere vibrating in its first mode, expansion and contraction [13]. In the near-field, pressure perturbations generated by a monopole fall off in proportion to 1/r, where r is the distance from the source. Dipole radiation usually arises from force fluctuations at a fluid–fluid or fluid–solid interface, and has a two-dimensional pressure field. This type of acoustic radiation would be generated by a rigid sphere oscillating side to side, or by two monopoles spaced closely together and vibrating out of phase [13]. In the near-field, pressure perturbations generated by a dipole fall off in proportion to 1/r\n               2. Quadrupole radiation arises from the fluctuating shear stresses within a turbulent fluid [14] and has a three-dimensional pressure field. This type of acoustic radiation would be generated by a sphere vibrating in its third mode, ellipsoidal distortion, or by two dipoles of opposite polarity situated side-by-side [13]. In the near-field, pressure perturbations generated by a quadrupole fall off in proportion to 1/r\n               3.\nBoiling produces monopole acoustic radiation as the expansion, and sometimes the subsequent collapse, of vapor bubbles within a heated fluid produce pressure fluctuations that propagate away from the forming bubble [15]. While this mechanism could be a significant source of sound in vents that are boiling [8], the temperatures of Sully and Puffer were about 15–20°C below the ~375°C boiling point of hydrothermal fluid at 2200 m depth [16] when we recorded their sound. Thus it is unlikely that boiling is a source of sound in these recordings.\nSimilar to boiling, cavitation also produces monopole radiation during the formation and collapse of vapor pockets. These pockets form in response to hydrodynamic pressure drops that bring local fluid pressures below the vapor pressure [17]. Cavitation can be a significant source of sound when it occurs [17], however the fluids issuing from Sully and Puffer are far from the two-phase curve [16], and are unlikely to cavitate as a result of hydrodynamic forces within these two chimneys [8].\nFree turbulence in a fluid generates quadrupole acoustic radiation which is associated with the fluctuating shear stresses in the flow [14]. The power output from this mechanism is typically quite small in low Mach number flows [18], [19]. Near-field pressure perturbations associated with this mechanism can be approximated by [8]:1where P is the root-mean-square pressure fluctuation, r is the fluid density, U is the mean fluid velocity, D is the vent orifice diameter, and r is the distance from the source. Letting r = 625 kg/m3 \n               [16], U = 1 m/s, D = 0.05 m, and r = 0.5 m, we find that pressure fluctuations associated with free turbulence may equal ~6×10−3 Pa. Such pressures are far below the ambient sound pressures recorded at the Main Endeavour field (Table 1), thus this source mechanism is not likely responsible for any of the acoustic radiation recorded in this study.\nTurbulent fluid flows containing heterogeneous density or compressibility fields can generate significantly more sound than uniform fluid flows [20]. Pockets of differing density or compressibility can interact with hydrodynamic pressure variations to produce dipole acoustic radiation with wavelengths that are much longer than the heterogeneity length scale [20]. In black smoker systems, this can result in pressure fluctuations that are a factor of ~4×102 greater than those generated by turbulent shear in a uniform flow [8]. Thus pressure perturbations generated by this source mechanism may equal ~2.4 Pa, which is similar in magnitude to the pressures measured near Sully and Puffer (Table 1), and suggests that fluid heterogeneity may play a role in sound production in these vents.\nMass flux variations at the vent orifice caused by pulsating flow can produce monopole acoustic radiation [18], [19]. This source mechanism functions much like a baffled piston [17], and the sound from this mechanism would originate from the plane of the vent orifice [18], [19]. Pressure perturbations associated with this mechanism can be approximated by [8]:2where Pp\n                is the root-mean-square pressure fluctuation of the pulsating flow. Letting Pp\n                equal 10 percent of the total mean pressure, which can be approximated by ρU\n               2 \n               [8], and letting r = 625 kg/m3 \n               [16], U = 1 m/s, and r = 0.5 m, we find that pressures from pulsating flow may equal ~3.7 Pa. Pressures of this magnitude would be easily detected over the background noise, and are indeed similar to those measured at both vents (Table 1). Thus pulsating flow may contribute to the sound signals recorded in this study.\nThe interaction of unsteady flow with the internal walls of the chimney can create force fluctuations at the fluid–solid interface, which can, in turn, cause the structure to vibrate and emit dipole acoustic radiation [9]. Sound from this mechanism would originate from within the chimney structure. It is difficult to predict the magnitude of acoustic pressure perturbations associated with source, as it will depend on many factors including the stiffness of the chimney and the geometry of the fluid conduits. However, this mechanism is strongly dependent on fluid flow, with acoustic intensities being proportional to roughly the fifth power of the mean flow rate [17], and coupling between the fluid and solid increasing with increased conduit roughness and tortuosity. Considering the rapid flow rates and the rough and often tortuous fluid pathways found in black smoker structures [21], we consider it possible that this sound source is significant in these systems.\nAnother potential sound source mechanism is related to fluid volume changes driven by the mixing of hydrothermal fluid with seawater. The equation of state for hydrothermal fluid at high temperatures and pressures predicts a significant volume decrease when this fluid mixes and exchanges heat with ambient seawater [16]. This process will produce monopole acoustic radiation with the source located in the jet mixing region some distance above the vent orifice. To the best of our knowledge, this sound source mechanism has not been investigated, thus there is no theory to quantify the magnitude of the pressure perturbations it may generate. However, considering the large density differences between hot and cold hydrothermal fluid [16], we consider it possible that this source is significant in these systems. Small-scale laboratory experiments could be used to investigate this mechanism and determine its sound production potential.\nThus we have identified four potential source mechanisms that might generate the broadband acoustic signals measured in this study, each of which being of a different mechanism class, and or having a different locus. Pulsating flow would generate monopole acoustic radiation with its locus situated at the vent orifice. Volume changes associated with the cooling of hydrothermal fluid would also generate monopole radiation, but with its locus situated in the mixing region of the jet. Fluid heterogeneity would generate dipole acoustic radiation with its locus situated in the mixing region of the jet. And fluid–structure interactions would generate dipole acoustic radiation with its locus situated within the chimney structure. The deployment of a hydrophone array in the near-field may therefore help discriminate between these possible sources by measuring the fall-off rate of the pressure fluctuations and by locating the sound sources.\nPotential narrowband sources within black smokers are related to the excitation of the acoustic modes of resonators by unsteady flow. Such resonance typically involves flow past cavities, or flow impinging upon solid bodies. Among the many possible resonators are Helmholtz resonators, half-wave or quarter-wave resonators, and solid structures such as tubes, plates, or cavities within the chimneys [22]–[24]. Considering the typical acoustic properties of black smoker fluids, and the geometry of these structures, the frequencies of the observed resonant signals are reasonable. For example, the fundamental frequency f of a Helmholtz resonator is given by [9]:3where c is the speed of sound in the fluid filling the cavity, A is the area of the cavity opening, V is the volume of the cavity, and L is the length of the cavity opening. For a relatively small 2-liter cavity connected to the chimney conduit by an opening of diameter 0.02 m and a length of 0.04 m, filled with hot hydrothermal fluid for which c = 450 m/s [16], f would equal ~120 Hz. For a quarter-wave oscillator, the first resonant mode is given by [23]:4where l is the length of the cavity. Thus for a 1-m tube closed at one end and filled with hot hydrothermal fluid, the fundamental frequency is ~113 Hz.\nBoth Sully and Puffer produce acoustic tones at several different frequencies. The different tones might be produced by different types of resonators, or by several resonators of a single type but with different geometries and different relationships to the fluid flow. In either case, the tones that are generated will depend strongly on the vent's morphological structure, and each vent within the vent field is likely to have its own unique acoustic signature.\n\n\nTemporal Variability\nThe relatively long timescale changes observed in the broadband and narrowband signals could be related to a variety of factors. Changes in fluid temperature or chemical composition could affect the density or compressibility of the fluid which are both critical parameters for all of the above-mentioned acoustic source mechanisms, and could affect both the amplitude and frequency content of the acoustic signals. Such changes in fluid temperature and composition are common in these systems [25]–[28]. Changes in fluid flow rate can also affect acoustic amplitudes and frequencies for several of the above-mentioned source mechanisms, such as fluid–structure interactions [17]. Changes in the geometry of the vent structure could also affect the acoustic signals. Either through episodic cracking events, or through gradual mineral deposition/dissolution, channels and voids within the structure may change shape, thereby affecting relative flow rates through the chimney, and the fundamental resonant frequencies of any resonant bodies. Such changes in vent geometry have been observed on these timescales [21].\nThe tidal variations in the Puffer record are likely related to changes in fluid discharge rate. The strongest evidence for this is the observed lag in acoustic output relative to high tide (Figure 6). Recent two-dimensional numerical models of tidally forced poroelastic convection within mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal systems predict that maximal discharge rates will lag high tide by ~125° [29]. Similar one-dimensional analytical models predict a lag of 135° [30]. Thus our observations are close to the expected values if it is assumed that faster discharge results in higher acoustic output—a good assumption for many of the potential acoustic source mechanisms. Other evidence shows that the tidal signal is not related to ocean currents, which are another conceivable source of tidal variability. We do not observe a ~4 cycles per day signal which would be associated with local current speeds that peak ~4 times per day [31]. We also do not observe a ~1.5 cycles per day signal which would be associated with the motions of regional inertial currents [32]. Thus it is likely that changes in discharge rate are reflected in the acoustic record, and further investigation into passive acoustic flow measurement techniques is warranted.\nIt is not entirely clear why the observed tidal variations are confined to the ~150–325 Hz and ~450–500 Hz frequency bands. We suspect that the acoustic power in these bands is dominated by source mechanisms that are more sensitive to flow rate, such as fluid–structure interactions, which can have intensities that depend on the fifth power of the fluid velocity [17]. The sound in the other parts of the spectrum could be generated by a source mechanism that is not as strongly dependent on mean discharge rate, such as pulsating exit flow [17]. This hypothesis could be tested with an array of hydrophones capable of determining which sound source mechanisms dominate in different frequency bands, by locating the sound sources in different bands, and measuring the near-field pressure distribution in different bands.\n\n\nBiological Implications\nSound production by black smokers has possible implications for local organisms. Considering the near-field sound pressure fall-off predicted for the likely sound source mechanisms, we estimate that vent sound levels would be above ambient levels at a distance of ~5–15 m from the vent orifice at the time our measurements were made. Thus fish, crustaceans, and cephalopods, which are common in these environments [33], [34] and can typically detect and process sound [35]–[38], might utilize this source of environmental information to their advantage. The acoustic detection of vent locations could help an organism avoid damage from hot hydrothermal fluid, and could provide foraging or reproductive benefits by helping an organism find food or a mating partner. An analogous adaptation is suspected in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge shrimp species Rimicaris exoculata which may use infrared light to locate hydrothermal vents [39]. In reef settings, certain fish larvae are known to use environmental sounds in their search for settlement habitat [40]. Novel field or laboratory studies could be used to investigate the effects of vent sounds on the local animal community.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur study shows that high-temperature seafloor vents produce high levels of acoustic radiation which can provide valuable information about geological and physical processes occurring within these systems, and may provide animals with information about the environment they inhabit. Several new lines of inquiry regarding the acoustical, geophysical and biological implications of hydrothermal vent sounds should soon be explored.\n\nWe developed two versions of the deep-sea digital acoustic recording system used in this study. Both versions were based on the Persistor CF2 microcontroller and both had 4 GB of flash memory capable of storing ~6–10 days of continuous sound data. Both versions could be equipped with two hydrophones, based on the Benthos AQ-2000 piezoceramic sensor element. One hydrophone was affixed to the instrument's titanium pressure case, and the other had a 3 m cable and was attached to a bracket allowing it to be positioned just a few centimeters from a black smoker vent orifice. We refer to these two hydrophones as the “case” and “remote” hydrophones, respectively. The first-generation system, used in 2004, sampled on three channels continuously at 1000 Hz with a 12-bit A/D converter and a fixed gain for each channel. The second-generation system, used in 2005, sampled on two channels continuously at 1920 Hz with a 16-bit A/D converter and a programmable gain. Additional information on the instrument specifications is shown in Table 2.In September 2004 we lowered the acoustic recording system to the seafloor using a free-falling platform (called an elevator) which landed about 150 m east of the Sully vent. The instrument recorded several hours of ambient noise at this location. We then used a remotely operated vehicle to move the instrument to the Sully vent, with the case hydrophone positioned approximately 0.3 m from the vent orifice, and the remote hydrophone positioned approximately 0.1 m from the orifice. Figure 2a shows the instrument deployed at Sully. The acoustic output of this vent was higher than expected, and the remote hydrophone signal was heavily clipped on both channels. The case hydrophone was sufficiently sensitive to record the vent sounds, thus all the 2004 data shown in this paper were collected with the case hydrophone. After about 45 hours of data collection, the remote hydrophone cable was destroyed by hot hydrothermal fluid, at which time the instrument stopped recording.In September 2005 we deployed the system at the Puffer vent with the case hydrophone positioned approximately 0.3 m from the vent orifice. The remote hydrophone had been destroyed by venting fluid in a previous deployment attempt during the same year, thus all of the 2005 data shown in this paper were collected with the case hydrophone. Figure 2b shows the instrument deployed at Puffer. After about 136 hours of data collection, the instrument was recovered, then placed on an elevator and returned to the seafloor to collect an ambient noise recording. The elevator landed about 25 m east of the Hulk vent in the northern part of the vent field, and at this location the instrument recorded several hours of data before being recovered.We converted the raw hydrophone values into units of zero-mean pressure by first applying a 1-Hz high-pass 4-pole Butterworth filter. We divided the signal by the overall system gain used by the recording instrument for that channel, then applied the nominal sensitivity of the hydrophone element as published by the manufacturer.We obtained 10-minute average spectra using Welch's method [41] with 215-point fast Fourier transforms applied to 9600-point sections of the record. Each section of the record overlapped adjacent sections by 50 percent, and was multiplied by a Hamming window [42]. These 10-minute spectra were then time averaged to obtain the representative hour-average spectra shown in Figure 3. The 10-minute spectra are contoured in Figure 4.We conducted the spectral analysis of the power time-series for different acoustic frequencies by first averaging the power into 5-Hz bands. For each of these records, we applied a 1-cycles-per-day high-pass 4-pole Butterworth filter, then normalized the record by its root-mean-square. Finally we multiplied each record by a 50-percent Tukey (cosine-taper) window [42], and computed periodograms using a 214-point fast Fourier transform. Contours of these periodograms are shown in Figure 5."

            "fulltext": "IntroductionThe fundamental problem of two-dimensional flow due to stretching plane surface, initially discussed by Crane [1], is involved in various industrial processes such as metal and polymer extrusion, drawing of plastic films, paper production etc. Owing to such applications, the researchers have discussed this problem under various aspects including suction or injection, variable surface temperature, convective boundary condition, mass transfer, mixed convection etc. The three-dimensional flow due to plane bi-directional linearly stretching sheet was first discussed by Wang [2]. He found an exact similarity solution of the classical Navier-Stokes equations. Later, Lakshmisha et al. [3] numerically examined the unsteady three-dimensional flow with heat and mass transfer over an unsteady stretching sheet. In contrast to this problem, Takhar et al. [4] investigated the three-dimensional flow of an electrically conducting fluid due to an impulsive motion of the stretching sheet. Ariel [4] derived approximate analytic and numeric solutions for steady three-dimensional flow over a stretching sheet. Xu et al. [5] provided uniformly valid series solutions for three-dimensional unsteady flow caused by the impulsively stretching sheet. Liu and Andersson [6] considered the heat transfer in three-dimensional flow due to non-isothermal stretching sheet. The unsteady three-dimensional flow of elastico-viscous fluid and mass transfer due to unsteady stretching sheet with constant wall concentration was studied by Hayat et al. [7]. In another paper, Hayat et al. [8] described the three-dimensional flow of Jeffrey fluid due to stretching sheet. Liu et al. [9] firstly discussed the three-dimensional flow due to exponentially stretching sheet numerically. Steady flow of nanofluid past a linearly bi-directional stretching sheet through Buongiorno's model was examined by Junaid et al. [10]. Sheikholeslami and Ganji [11] discussed the flow and heat transfer of nanofluid between parallel sheets in the presence of Brownian motion and thermophoresis effects.\nThe literature cited above deals only with the case of either linearly or exponentially driven velocity of the sheet. Vajravelu [12] numerically discussed the viscous flow due to stretching sheet when the velocity of the sheet was assumed to obey the power-law distribution, i.e.. He computed numerical solutions for various values of power-law index  Cortell [13] extended this problem by considering viscous dissipation effects and variable surface temperature. The steady boundary layer flow of micropolar fluid over non-linearly stretching sheet was discussed by Bhargava et al. [14]. Radiation and viscous dissipation effects on the boundary layer flow above a non-linearly stretching sheet were explored by Cortell [15]. Homotopy analytic solutions for mixed convection flow of micropolar fluid past a non-linearly stretching vertical sheet were obtained by Hayat et al. [16]. Kechil and Hashim [17] derived analytic solutions for MHD flow over a non-linearly stretching sheet by Adomian decomposition method. Hayat et al. [18] used modified decomposition method for the series solutions of MHD flow of an electrically conducting fluid over a non-linearly stretching surface. The impact of chemical reaction on the flow over a non-linearly stretching sheet embedded in a porous medium was investigated by Ziabakhsh et al. [19]. Rana and Bhargava [20] computed numerical solutions for two-dimensional flow of nanofluid due to non-linearly stretching sheet by finite element method. Shahzad et al. [21] obtained closed form exact solutions for axisymmetric flow and heat transfer when the velocity of the stretching sheet was proportional to . Partial slip effects on the boundary layer flow past a non-linearly permeable stretching surface have been addressed by Mukhopadhyay [22]. In another paper, Mukhopadhyay [23] analyzed the flow and heat transfer of Casson fluid due to non-linearly stretching sheet. Rashidi et al. [24] derived homotopy based analytic solutions for flow over a non-isothermal stretching plate with transpiration.\nTo our knowledge, the three-dimensional flow due to non-linearly stretching sheet has not been yet reported. It is obvious that three-dimensional flows can be appropriate in giving more clear physical insights of the real world problem when compared with the two-dimensional flows. The present work is therefore undertaken to fill such a void. The study also assumes that the temperature across the sheet is non-linearly distributed. Introducing a new set of similarity variables the boundary layer equations are first reduced into self-similar forms and then solved both analytically and numerically. It is pertinent to mention that computation of either approximate analytic or numerical solutions of the boundary layer equations governing the flow and heat transfer is often challenging (see [25]–[33] for details). Attention is focused on the physical interpretation of parameters including the power-law index \nMathematical ModelingLet us consider the three-dimensionalincompressible flow over a plane elastic sheet located at  as shown in the Fig. 1. The flow is induced due to stretching of the sheet in two lateral directions.

            "abstract": [
                "\n        In this paper we describe the repeated replacement method (RRM), a new meshfree method for computational fluid dynamics (CFD). RRM simulates fluid flow by modeling compressible fluids’ tendency to evolve towards a state of constant density, velocity, and pressure. To evolve a fluid flow simulation forward in time, RRM repeatedly “chops out” fluid from active areas and replaces it with new “flattened” fluid cells with the same mass, momentum, and energy. We call the new cells “flattened” because we give them constant density, velocity, and pressure, even though the chopped-out fluid may have had gradients in these primitive variables. RRM adaptively chooses the sizes and locations of the areas it chops out and replaces. It creates more and smaller new cells in areas of high gradient, and fewer and larger new cells in areas of lower gradient. This naturally leads to an adaptive level of accuracy, where more computational effort is spent on active areas of the fluid, and less effort is spent on inactive areas. We show that for common test problems, RRM produces results similar to other high-resolution CFD methods, while using a very different mathematical framework. RRM does not use Riemann solvers, flux or slope limiters, a mesh, or a stencil, and it operates in a purely Lagrangian mode. RRM also does not evaluate numerical derivatives, does not integrate equations of motion, and does not solve systems of equations.\n      "

            "fulltext": "IntroductionIn this paper, we first present background material on CFD and discuss previous CFD methods which have informed this work. Then we motivate RRM and explain its workings in depth. Next, we show that RRM gives correct results for many standard test problems. We also demonstrate that RRM shows steadily decreasing error in its solutions as we increase the desired accuracy, and that RRM handles many common types of boundary conditions. Finally, we discuss the similarities and differences between RRM and other CFD methods.\n\nBackground\nCFD is the use of numerical methods to model liquid and gas flow. CFD has many practical uses, from the analysis of the airflow over vehicles to the design of water turbines.\nCFD covers a vast range of fluid compositions and flow types. For simplicity, we only consider a fluid that is:\n\n\n\n\nContinuous: Infinitely subdividable, unlike real fluids which are made of discrete atoms and molecules.\n\nSimple: Completely described by density, velocity, and pressure at each point, which we call the “primitive variables”, and write as ρ, u, and p. We do not consider other possible fluid properties like chemical reactivity. We also do not consider the action of non-pressure forces like gravity or electromagnetism on the fluid.\n\nIdeal: Described by the ideal gas law, in which the internal energy of a fluid is purely a function of ρ, p, and γ. The constant γ is called the ratio of specific heats, and has a value of about 1.4 for air.\n\nSingle-phase: Consisting entirely of either liquid or gas, but not a mixture of the two. This means we need not model liquid-gas interfaces. We also do not consider the interaction of solid objects with the fluid.\n\nInviscid: Having no resistance to deformation. This simplifies the equations of fluid motion.\n\nAdiabatic across contacts: Allowing no heat to flow from one side of a contact discontinuity to the other. This means that contact-adjacent regions will not tend towards the same temperature. We compare RRM’s results to fluid flows that are adiabatic across contacts because of the availability of analytic solutions, but we show later that RRM is not adiabatic across contacts.\n\nOne-dimensional: Having only one spatial dimension. This makes illustration and programming simpler.\n\nEven though our fluid is infinitely subdividable, for illustration and analysis we divide it into finite-sized cells. Figure 1 shows a cell c1 with its left edge at x1 and its right edge at x2. The density, velocity, and pressure components are shown on separate graphs.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.  Fluid cell with three separate components.Fluid cell c1 has density, velocity, and pressure components ρ, u, and p. The left and right coordinates of the cell are x1 and x2.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g001When we do not need to show all three components separately, we combine them onto one axis for simplicity as shown in figure 2, with the understanding that ρ, u, and p may have different values even though they are drawn with the same line.\nWe can describe fluid flow with cells in two main ways. The Eulerian description considers the cells to be stationary, and the fluid to flow across their edges and through them. The Lagrangian description considers the cells to move along with the fluid, so any given bit of fluid is always found in the same cell. We will initially use the Eulerian description since it is the most common. We will later switch to the Lagrangian description when we describe RRM in more detail.\nGiven the restrictions and cell definition above, we can model fluid flow with a set of equations called the Euler equations, which can be derived from the local conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. The Euler equations take on different forms depending on whether we write them for the Eulerian or Lagrangian description of fluid flow. For the Eulerian description, we write the Euler equations in English like this:\n\n\n\n\nConservation of mass: The mass in a cell changes by the amount that flows across its edges.\n\nConservation of momentum: The momentum in a cell changes by the amount that flows across its edges, and by the amount due to the pressure acting on its edges.\n\nConservation of energy: The energy in a cell changes by the amount that flows across its edges, and by the amount due to work done by the pressure acting on its edges.\n\nThe Euler equations are typically written as partial differential equations, but we write them here as integral equations because it is more natural for our derivative-free numerical method. Here are the Euler equations for a cell, written for the Eulerian description of fluid flow, in conservation form:(1)\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 2.

The left and right coordinates of the cell are x1 and x2.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g002The coordinates x1 and x2 are the left and right edges of the cell. The times t1 and t2 are the starting and ending times of a period where fluid is flowing into and out of the cell, and pressure is acting on the cell edges.\nThis form is called the conservation form because it is written in terms of the conserved quantities per unit length. These conserved quantities are mass per unit length ρ, momentum per unit length ρu, and energy per unit length ρeT.\nThe specific total energy eT is the energy per unit mass due to both macroscopic and microscopic motion. The ideal gas law gives us equations for eT and for the speed of sound a, which we will use later.(2)(3)\nTo write the Euler equations in a more compact form we define a vector of the conserved quantities(4)and a vector of the fluxes (plus the pressure and pressure work) at the edges\n(5)Then the Euler equations can be written as a single vector equation(6)\nFor the general initial conditions ρ(x,t1), u(x,t1), and p(x,t1), the Euler equations have no known analytical solution. This is inconvenient when we wish to check the results of a numerical method. So in this paper we restrict ourselves to simple initial conditions known as the Riemann problem, where ρ, u, and p take on the constant values (ρl, ul, pl) and (ρr, ur, pr) on the left and right sides of an initial discontinuity, as shown in figure 3.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 3.  The Riemann problem.The Riemann problem specifies initial density, velocity, and pressure values of ρl, ul, pl on the left side of the origin and ρr, ur, pr on the right side of the origin.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g003Unlike the general initial conditions, the Riemann problem has an analytical solution, though this solution contains a nonlinear implicit equation and a number of special cases that we must treat carefully. In this paper, we use a Riemann solver due to Toro [1] as a standard to test RRM’s results against. Many CFD methods, beginning with Godunov’s method in 1959 [2], use an embedded Riemann solver as a part of their algorithms, though RRM does not.\nEven for the Riemann problem, accurate numerical solutions to the Euler equations are challenging, mainly because the solutions can include discontinuities. At these discontinuities, the spatial derivatives in the differential form of the Euler equations are undefined, which spoils many simple numerical methods and requires special-case code in more advanced methods.\nIn the solutions to many other partial differential equations such as the heat equation, initial discontinuities will smear out and become increasingly smooth over time. But in the solutions to the Euler equations, initial discontinuities do not always smear out, and indeed new discontinuities may arise over time.\nFor example, consider Sod’s shock tube problem [3], a special case of the Riemann problem. A shock tube is a gas-filled tube with a diaphragm in the center. The diaphragm is initially airtight, so the left and right sides of the tube can be separately charged to specific pressures and densities as shown in figure 4, which sets (ρl, ul, pl) = (1.0, 0.0, 1.0) on the left side, and (ρr, ur, pr) = (0.125, 0.0, 0.1) on the right side.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 4.

Figure 5 shows the fluid at t = 1.5 seconds. We can see both types of discontinuity that are possible in solutions to the Euler equations, as well as the “expansion fan” that joins the high-pressure left state to the flat area in the center.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 5.  Sod’s shock tube problem at t = 1.5 seconds.Sod’s shock tube problem showing density ρ, velocity u, and pressure p after 1.5 seconds of time evolution. We can see three flow features: an expansion fan, a contact, and a shock.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g005The first type of discontinuity, a contact, separates two areas that differ only in density. Contacts travel along with the fluid, and since velocity is constant across a contact, no fluid flows across them. Contacts cannot form spontaneously; they must either be present in the initial conditions as in Sod’s problem, or they must be formed by the intersection of two shocks. As a real-world example, if stationary hot and cold water masses are carefully placed side by side, they will be separated by a contact discontinuity, at least until heat energy flows across the discontinuity and smears it out.\nThe second kind of discontinuity, a shock, can be formed by a pressure gradient steep enough to force the fluid to move faster than the local speed of sound a. Shocks can develop over time, and need not be present in the initial conditions. Density, velocity, and pressure can all change across a shock. As a real-world example, if you pilot a boat through the water faster than waves can travel through the water, the boat creates a shock at its bow.\nThe 2D graphs of Sod’s shock tube problem above show flow features at specific times, but do not show how the fluid flow evolves over time. Figure 6 uses 3D to add a time dimension.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 6.

We can see three flow features: an expansion fan, a contact, and a shock. The contact and the shock both start at the origin and move to the right, with the shock running ahead due to its higher speed. The expansion fan gradually slopes left as more and more fluid flows to the right to feed the shock.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g006These graphs show how the contact and the shock both start at the origin and move to the right, with the shock running ahead due to its higher speed. They also show how the expansion fan gradually slopes left as more and more fluid flows to the right to feed the travelling shock.\nFor subsequent figures we will mainly use 2D graphs, since they allow easier comparison of our results with those of a Riemann solver. We will use 3D only when the time evolution of the flow is of special interest, such as when we illustrate boundary conditions.\n\n\nPrevious Work\nIf you simply use the definition of the derivative to convert the Euler equations from differential equations to algebraic equations, you get the finite difference method (FDM). In conservation form, FDM models a fluid as a set of cells, each of which contains the values of the conserved quantities at a point within the cell. The explicit version of FDM calculates those values at the next time step from the values in nearby cells at the current time step. The set of nearby cells is called the stencil.\nThe finite volume method (FVM) also models a fluid as a set of cells, but it stores cell average values instead of point samples in the cells. In its explicit conservation form, FVM calculates the values at the next time step by adding and subtracting fluxes of the conserved quantities across each neighboring cell’s edges during the time step.\nThe finite element method (FEM) was historically used for structural mechanics [4], but began to find use in fluid dynamics [5] as the method was generalized and applied to time-varying problems. FEM starts by creating a mesh of elements (cells in our terminology) which are shaped to fit the problem geometry. FEM then solves a system of equations at each time step to determine the unknown fluid values in each element. Fluid values in FEM are typically stored in piecewise polynomial form, as opposed to the point samples of FDM or the cell averages of FVM.\nIn FDM and FVM, the fluid is usually considered to move through stationary cells in a single, global coordinate system. This is the Eulerian description of fluid flow mentioned above.\nFigure 7 shows an example with three stationary cells c1, c2, and c3. The measuring points xm1, xm2, and xm3 are at the cell centers. The entire fluid has a rightward velocity u. In panel A at time t1, we measure cell c1’s ρ and p values at xm1, and c2’s values at xm2. Cell c3 is empty.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 7.  Eulerian description of fluid flow.In the Eulerian description of fluid flow, the fluid moves through stationary cells. Consider a global coordinate system divided into three cells c1, c2, and c3. The fluid is traveling rightwards with velocity u. In panel A at time t1, a measurement at point xm1 will show the density ρ and pressure p of cell c1. In panel B at a later time t2 = (xm2– xm1)/u, we measure the same density and pressure at point xm2 because the fluid has moved to the right by one cell width.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g007In panel B at a later time t2 = (xm2– xm1)/u, all the fluid from c1 has moved into c2, and all the fluid from c2 has moved into c3. Now we measure the same ρ and p values at xm2 that we previously measured at xm1, and the same values at xm3 that we previously measured at xm2. The fluid has moved one cell width to the right, but the cells themselves have stayed in place.\nEulerian methods are relatively simple to implement, but shocks, contacts and other steep gradients may smear out or gain unphysical oscillations as they cross cell edges, depending on the algorithm used. Researchers have proposed many refinements over the years to increase accuracy, such as Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) methods [6], Essentially Non-Oscillatory (ENO) methods [7], Monotone Upwind Schemes for Scalar Conservation Laws (MUSCL) [8], the Piecewise-Parabolic Method (PPM) [9], and many more.\nAnother approach to Eulerian fluid flow is the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) [10]. Instead of a mesh of cells, LBM uses a lattice of connected sites, each of which can “stream” fluid to a fixed number of neighboring sites. Each site contains a distribution function that represents how much fluid is streaming in each direction. After each streaming step, LBM executes a “collision” step at each site to alter the distribution functions to maintain conservation. LBM has many attractive features, including ease of programming and simple handling of boundary conditions.\nIn contrast to FDM, FVM, and LBM, FEM often uses the alternative Lagrangian description of fluid flow, in which the cells travel along with the fluid.\nFigure 8 shows an example, with two cells c1 and c2 moving to the right with a velocity u, similar to the Eulerian example above. However, in the Lagrangian description the fluid does not move across cell edges. Instead, the cells themselves move, carrying local coordinate systems along with them.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 8.  Lagrangian description of fluid flow.In the Lagrangian description of fluid flow, the cells are part of the fluid and move along with it. Consider fluid cells c1 and c2 traveling with their own local coordinate systems. The cells and their coordinate systems are both traveling rightwards at velocity u in the global coordinate system. In panel A at time t1, and in panel B at any later time t2, points xm1 and xm2 in the cells’ coordinate systems remain at the same places in those cells. No fluid crosses cell edges.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g008Panel A shows us measuring the values at time t1 of ρ and p at point xm1 in the local coordinate system of cell c1. Panel B shows that we will measure the same values at any later time t2, since cell c1 and its coordinate system move together. The same holds true for cell c2 in its local coordinate system at its own point xm2.\nLagrangian methods handle shocks and contacts naturally, because those flow features travel with the fluid instead of smearing out as they cross cell edges. But pure Lagrangian methods are rare, because as the fluid flows, the cells can become excessively bunched up, stretched out, or deformed, which can reduce simulation accuracy and efficiency.\nThe cells of FDM, FVM, and FEM, and the lattice sites of LBM, are usually connected in a mesh. Each cell has a well-defined shape, and each cell or site has a fixed set of neighbors. In simple methods, these shapes and sets of neighbors are constant over the whole course of the simulation. But in Eulerian methods, a fluid may have complex flow features that move around over time, so we may want to create smaller cells in those complex areas and larger cells in other areas. Or in Lagrangian methods, some cells may become degenerate or singular in a complex flow, so that the method’s equation solver no longer works correctly.\nThe process of changing the mesh to alleviate these problems is called remeshing. Figure 9 panel A shows eight small fluid cells, and panel B shows those eight cells remeshed into two cells that cover the same area.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 9.  Remeshing.The eight cells in panel A can be remeshed into two cells in panel B that cover the same area and contain the same mass, momentum, and energy. Some CFD methods require remeshing to maintain accuracy or to prevent numerical difficulties.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g009To avoid this complication, the so-called meshfree methods do away with mesh connectivity entirely. One of the first meshfree methods was smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) [11], [12]. SPH is a purely Lagrangian method which models a fluid with a set of moving particles, and computes the fluid’s properties at any point by summing the contributions of nearby particles using a kernel function which smooths out the particles’ properties over some “smoothing length”. SPH was originally motivated by the study of astrophysical problems such as galaxy formation, where the constituents were already discrete particles. SPH was later applied to other problems where the fluid was presumed to be continuous before being discretized.\nThe moving-particle semi-implicit method (MPS) [13] is a meshfree method similar to SPH, which was originally intended for simulation of incompressible fluids with interacting free surfaces. It also uses a kernel function (called a weight function in the MPS literature), but one which is specially designed to repel particles at short distance, thereby maintaining approximately constant density in the fluid. MPS has been applied to many situations, including simulations of coastal waves and dam breaks.\nMuch research in meshfree methods has been done in recent years, and there is now a great variety of such methods with different kernel functions, particle properties, and integration techniques. Li and Liu [14] and Huerta et al. [15] have both written excellent surveys of the field.\n\nMethods\nMotivation\nRRM was motivated by Chaikin’s corner-cutting algorithm for curve generation, which evolved into the subdivision curves of computational geometry [16], [17]. A curve of this type starts as a set of lines joined end to end to form a roughly faceted curve, shown in figure 10 panel A. First we cut off each of the corners one-quarter of the way along each side, shown in panel B. Then we cut the corners off the new corners, shown in panel C, iteratively refining the curve into smaller and smaller line segments, until a desired level of smoothness is reached in panel D.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 10.

Panels C and D show the process carried out two more times. We can repeat this process until the curve has any desired smoothness.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g010RRM does the same sort of iterative refinement, but on a moving fluid instead of a stationary curve, and with constraints on conservation of mass, momentum and energy rather than constraints on surface continuity and smoothness.\n\n\nOverview\nTo begin, we divide a fluid into finite-sized cells. In one dimension, each cell is a line segment with an associated density, velocity, and pressure, all of which are constant across the cell. Figure 11 shows a fluid divided into three cells c1, c2, and c3. For now we use periodic boundary conditions, so the left side of c1 is adjacent to the right side of c3. We indicate this with the dotted line on the right of c3.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 11.

Each pair of tracer particles defines an expanding wavefront of change that originates at the cell edge. For example, in figure 12 we show w23, the wavefront originating between c2 and c3, along with its left tracer particle pl and its right tracer particle pr.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 12.

Wavefront w23 originates between c2 and c3, and contains tracer particles pl and pr that travel through the fluid at the local speed of sound a = sqrt(γp/ρ). The constant γ depends on the fluid (it has a value of 1.4 for air). The ρ and p values are those of the cell the particle is traveling through. Note that w31 (not labeled) extends into both c3 and c1 due to the periodic boundary conditions.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g012As each tracer particle travels, it accumulates an error metric that tracks how much each of the primitive variable values has changed, and over what distance. Figure 13 shows a tracer particle p, the right-hand particle of wavefront w, moving through the fluid. The particle’s error metric Δ grows as the particle moves, with the slope of Δ changing when the particle crosses each cell edge.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 13.

Its error metric Δ increases as the particle travels, with the slope of Δ changing at cell edges.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g013When this error metric for either of the two tracer particles in any wavefront exceeds a preset maximum, we chop the wavefront area out of the fluid, flatten the chopped-out cell parts into a single new cell, and insert that new cell into the hole left by the chopping.\nIn areas of the fluid where primitive variable values differ greatly from cell to cell, tracer particles’ error metrics will accumulate quickly, so new cells will be chopped out soon after wavefront creation. This leads to more, smaller cells in areas of the fluid with steep slopes. Conversely, in areas where values are very similar from one cell to the next, error metrics will accumulate slowly, so we will chop out fewer, larger cells in areas of the fluid with shallow slopes.\nWe illustrate this whole process in figure 14. In panel A, we chop wavefront w23 out of the fluid, removing the wavefront’s tracer particles from the fluid at the same time. This leaves us with chopped cell parts c2c and c3c, shown in panel B. Panel C shows us flattening c2c and c3c into a new cell c4 of the same mass, momentum and energy. Then in panel D we insert c4 into the fluid and create new wavefronts w24 and w43 at the cell edges.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 14.  Chopping, flattening, and new cell creation.Panel A shows the chopping of wavefront w23 out of the fluid, which chops off the right side of c2 and the left side of c3. Panel B shows the resulting chopped parts c2c and c3c. Panel C shows the flattening of the two chopped parts into a new cell c4 with the same mass, momentum, and energy. Panel D shows the insertion of the new cell c4 into the fluid and the creation of the new wavefronts w24 and w43 on its edges.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g014The chop-flatten-create process always results in exactly one new cell, and always shrinks two other cells by chopping parts off of them. But this process can also remove any number of whole cells if the maximum error metric allows the wavefront to grow wide enough. For example, if wavefront w23 in figure 14 had grown wider, it could have chopped off the right side of c1, entirely removed c2, and chopped off the left side of c3, resulting in no net change in the number of cells. An even wider wavefront which removes two whole cells would reduce the total number of cells in the fluid by one, and so on. This is how RRM increases and decreases the total number of cells over time to adapt to changing fluid conditions.\nThe last step in the RRM algorithm is to choose the next wavefront whose tracer particles have reached the maximum error metric and repeat the chop-flatten-create process detailed above. This repetition evolves the fluid simulation forward in time.\n\n\nStored Quantities\nIn each cell, we store three main types of data:\n\n\n\n\nThe size, shape, and position of the cell. In one dimension, cells have only width, so we need only store the time-varying x coordinate x1(t) of the cell’s left edge, and the cell’s width w.\n\nThe cell’s three primitive variable values ρ, u, and p.\n\nFour extra vector quantities which help us ensure conservation.\n\nBelow we explain the relationships between these quantities and show how to derive other necessary values from them.\nRRM is purely Lagrangian and represents the fluid as finite-sized cells, so we use the integral Lagrangian form of the Euler equations, written in terms of the primitive variables:(7)\nThe values m1 and m2 are the mass coordinates of the left and right side of the cell. The mass coordinates move with the fluid, unlike the fixed spatial coordinates x1 and x2 that we used in the Eulerian form of these equations in equation set 1. This means that the fluid between m1 and m2 stays between m1 and m2, with no fluid flow across the cell edges. We can get the mass coordinate m at a point in the fluid from the Eulerian coordinate x at that point by integrating all the mass up to that point:(8)\nSo the value of the mass coordinate at any point is the sum of all the mass to the left of that point in the fluid.\nNote that the conservation of mass equation does not appear in equation set 7. That is because the mass between m1 and m2 is constant, so that equation would be trivial. Instead we show the conservation of volume equation, which merely says that a cell’s volume v changes as its edges move towards or away from each other. In the Eulerian form of these equations, it was the conservation of volume equation that was trivially equal to a constant, so we omitted it from equation set 1.\nNote also that the equations for the conservation of momentum and energy are simpler in the Lagrangian form than in the Eulerian form. This is because we do not need the flux terms that describe momentum and energy flowing across the cell edges, now that the cell edges move with the fluid.\nAs we saw with the Eulerian form, if we define a vector of the conserved quantities(9)and a vector of the velocity, pressure and pressure work at the cell edges(10)then the Lagrangian form of the Euler equations can be written as a single vector equation\n(11)We do not store the cells’ conserved quantities directly, but we can calculate them by integrating over the primitive variables. Since our primitive variables are piecewise constant, the integrals are simply multiplications by w, the width of the cell.(12)\nTo allow our flattening process to exchange energy between kinetic and potential forms while remaining conservative, we store two extra vector quantities on each edge of each cell: pressure momentum and pressure energy.\nFigure 15 shows these quantities for a single cell c1. We define them as follows:\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 15.  Pressure momentum and pressure energy vectors.A single cell c1 showing left and right pressure momentum Ppl and Ppr, and left and right pressure energy Epl and Epr. Portions of these vectors are transferred to new cells during the chopping and flattening process, and this transfer is what causes the conversion between potential and kinetic energy and vice versa.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g015(13)The first quantity Δt is the time it takes a tracer particle to cross a cell, and also the time it takes for a cell to completely expend its store of pressure momentum and pressure momentum upon its neighbors. The next four quantities are the terms on the right-hand sides of the momentum and energy Euler equations from equation set 7. They represent the changes in momentum and energy due to pressure work that a cell has the potential to cause to its neighbors. We store equal quantities of Pp and Ep in each direction, so for each cell they sum to zero, leaving the overall momentum and energy of the fluid unchanged.\nAs the fluid evolves, the total fluid mass, momentum, and energy remain strictly constant when these extra Pp and Ep vectors are summed along with the cells’ mass, momentum, and energy.(14)\nThis insures strict conservation of mass, momentum, and energy over the course of the simulation.\n\n\nCell Chopping and Flattening\nWhen we chop off one side of a cell, we are removing five quantities: mass, momentum and energy, plus part of the pressure momentum and pressure energy from the vectors on the chopped-off edge of the cell. Figure 16 shows this for a single cell c1. Panel A shows the quantities remaining in c1 after chopping, and panel B shows the quantities that are chopped off to form cell part c1c.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 16.  Chopping pressure momentum and pressure energy vectors.Panel A shows a single cell c1 with the right side chopped off. Panel B shows the chopped mass, momentum, energy, pressure momentum Pp, and pressure energy Ep that are now contained in the chopped cell part c1c, which will be flattened into a new cell along with any other cells chopped out by the same wavefront. The amounts of mass, momentum, and energy transferred to c1c are proportional to the width of c1c, but the amounts of pressure momentum and pressure energy transferred to c1c are proportional to the time since the creation of c1.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g016Note that we chop off mass, momentum and energy in amounts proportional to the width of the chopped part, but we chop off pressure momentum and pressure energy in an amount proportional to the time since the chopped cell was created. This is because mass, momentum and energy are inherent properties of the fluid that must be integrated over space, whereas pressure momentum and pressure energy act over time to convert energy from potential to kinetic form when there is a gradient in the fluid pressure. We can see this in equation set 7, where the left-side integrals are spatial, and the right-side integrals are temporal. In RRM, we treat Pp and Ep as acting steadily over time, starting at time tc when a cell is created, and ending at time tc+Δt, the time at which both of the cell’s tracer particles (the left wavefront’s right particle, and the right wavefront’s left particle) leave the cell.\nWhen chopping out a new cell, we first determine its intersections with existing cells. Then we chop off those intersections and add up all the mass M, momentum P, and energy E the intersections contained. Then, using the width of the new cell w and the requirement that density, velocity, and pressure are constant across it, we can calculate the flattened values of the primitive variables for the new cell.(15)\n\n\nNegative Pressure Fix\nVery occasionally, the flattening process will produce a cell with negative pressure, either because of rounding or truncation error, or because a very small wavefront chops a large amount of pressure momentum and pressure energy, which would accelerate the newly created small cell more than its store of potential energy can support.\nWhen this happens, we flatten the cell without adding in the chopped pressure momentum and pressure energy, which turns off pressure-to-momentum conversion for that cell and gives us a positive pressure after flattening. The unused pressure momentum and pressure energy are added to that of the newly created cell, which spreads the pressure-to-momentum conversion out over a slightly longer time.\nWhitehurst’s signal method [18] uses a similar fix for negative pressures, but averages over space instead of time. When negative pressure occurs in a cell, the signal method averages that cell’s mass, momentum and energy with its three neighbors, in proportion to their volumes.\n\n\nTracer Particles and Their Error Metric\nThe movement of the tracer particles through the cells of the fluid models the movement of characteristics or acoustic wavefronts through the fluid. The tracer particles do not represent real physical particles, they are merely a computational device. They do not carry mass, momentum, or energy, they do not interact with each other, and they do not affect cells’ properties. They always travel at the local speed of sound a in the cell that contains them.\nAs the tracer particles move through the fluid, we accumulate an error metric that tells us when to stop and chop out a new cell. The error metric Δ1,n is the error accumulated by a tracer particle as it travels from cell 1 to cell n.(16)where di is the distance the tracer particle travels in cell i, and the metric vector Mi for cell i is(17)When Δ1,n for either tracer particle exceeds a user-supplied Δmax, we chop out a new cell.\nThis error metric needs a bit of explaining. First, the metric is a vector of all the primitive variables (instead of choosing just one or two) so that variation in any of them across the fluid can trigger the chopping of a new cell. So our maximum error metric Δmax is a vector Δmax = [Δmax ρ, Δmax u, Δmax p]T, with each value set separately by the user. When we say that Δ1,n exceeds Δmax, we mean that some element of Δ1,n exceeds the corresponding element of Δmax.\nWe take the absolute value of Mi – Mi–1 so the error metric will increase monotonically as the tracer particle travels. If we did not, the error metric might go up and down many times without exceeding Δmax, which could lead to chopping out new cells that contain more total variation in the primitive variable values than we meant to allow.\nWe multiply the error metric by distance so that the error metric grows even as the tracer particles move across cells, not just as the particles cross cell edges. This prevents us from chopping out unduly large new cells in areas of shallow density, velocity, or pressure gradients.\nThere is also a special case in this formula. When i is 1, M0 is the metric vector of the cell on the other side of the edge from where the tracer particle was created. So the tracer particle does not travel through cell 0, but its metric vector contributes to the overall error metric.\nFigure 17 panel A shows two tracer particles pl and pr traveling through a fluid as part of wavefront w23. Panel B shows how the error metrics Δpl and Δpr of the two particles change as the particles travel.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 17.  Error metric growing as particles cross cell edges.Panel A shows two particles pl and pr traveling through the fluid as part of wavefront w23. Panel B shows the particles’ error metrics Δpl and Δpr growing as the particles travel, and demonstrates how the error metric of each particle in a wavefront is tracked separately. Note how the slope of the error metric across each cell is proportional to the difference in the cells’ density ρ, velocity u, and pressure p at the edge the particle crossed to get into the cell.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g017Note that the slopes of Δpl and Δpr are shallow in the center of the graph, because the density, velocity, and pressure of c2 and c3 are similar. As the particles cross into c1 and c4, the slopes of Δpl and Δpr increase substantially, which means that w23 will reach Δmax sooner than it would have with a shallower gradient in the fluid.\n\n\nWavefront Unioning\nWhen we choose a wavefront that we wish to chop the fluid with, we first must check for overlap with other wavefronts. The final area we chop out will be the union of the first wavefront with all the wavefronts that overlap it, and all the wavefronts that overlap them, and so on. Figure 18 shows an example: if we choose w12, we see that it overlaps w23, which overlaps w34, so the final area we would have to chop is wunion.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 18.  Wavefront unioning.A fluid divided into four cells c1, c2, c3, and c4. Wavefront w12 overlaps wavefront w23, which overlaps wavefront w34, so we must chop out the union wavefront wunion to properly account for the effects of each wavefront on the others.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g018Wavefront unioning was motivated by the observation that once two expanding wavefronts overlap, the fluid in each one has affected the fluid in the other, so they can no longer be treated separately.\nWavefront unioning turns out to be essential for the stability of the simulation. Without wavefront unioning, it is possible to chop out an area that contains unbalanced pressure momentum and pressure energy, even in a perfectly “flat” fluid that has no density or pressure gradient. This imbalance can cause a newly-created cell’s velocity to be abnormally high, which causes a glitch in the simulation where fluid cells pile up or spread out in an unphysical way.\nConsider figure 19 panel A, which shows three cells c1, c2, and c3 with ρ = 1, u = 0, and p = 1. We call this the “213 problem” because the widths of the cells are 2, 1, and 3 from left to right.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 19.  The “213 problem”.Panel A shows a fluid divided into three cells c1, c2, c3 of widths 2, 1, and 3 from left to right (hence the name “213 problem”). All three cells were created at time t = 0, and all three have density ρ = 1, pressure p = 1, and velocity u = 0. In a simulation without wavefront unioning, if wavefront w23 chopped out a new cell at time t = 2.5, that new cell would have a net momentum of −0.5. Panel B shows that this is because the rightward momentum Ppr from c1 levels off at t = 2.0, while the leftward momentum from c3 continues to increase until t = 3.0. This demonstrates that wavefront unioning is required to avoid unphysical changes in cell velocity during simulation.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g019Assume that all three cells were created at time t = 0, and that the speed of sound a = 1. Since there is no density or pressure gradient, chopping out a new cell anywhere in this fluid should result in a new cell with ρ = 1, u = 0, and p = 1.\nLet us consider wavefront w23 expanding from the right side of c2 and see if this is true. At time t = 2, w23 will contain equal and opposite amounts of pressure momentum from c1 and c3, since Ppr1 = 2 and Ppl3 = −2. The pressure momenta Ppl2 and Ppr2 from c2 will cancel since the whole cell is covered, so the overall pressure momentum Pp = Ppr1+Ppl2+Ppr2+Ppl3 contained in w23 is zero, as shown by the dotted line at t = 2. So far, so good.\nAt time t = 2.5, the pressure momentum Ppr1 from c1 is still 2, since it ran out of pressure momentum to contribute at t = 2. But the pressure momentum Ppl3 from c3 is −2.5, since it will not run out until time t = 3.0. Figure 19 panel B shows how the wavefront’s left and right pressure momenta Ppl = Ppl2+Ppl3 and Ppr = Ppr1+Ppr2 increase as the wavefront expands, with Ppr leveling off at t = 2 when Ppr1 stops increasing.\nSo if we chop out a new cell at time t = 2.5, it will have an overall pressure momentum Pp of −0.5, as shown by the dotted line at t = 2.5. This will make the new cell move to the left, even though there is no pressure gradient in the fluid! Unioning w23 with w12 (not shown) fixes this problem.\nThe analysis of the 213 problem shows that if we run a simulation without wavefront unioning, it will show occasional unphysical glitches. Since mass, momentum, and energy are all strictly conserved, the glitches sometimes smooth out over time, but if a glitch is big enough, it may create a large local gradient and significantly slow down simulation. Wavefront unioning avoids this problem.\n\n\nDiscrete Event Simulation\nRRM uses a discrete event simulation flow. We keep a priority queue of events, sorted in order of increasing event time. There are two kinds of events: particle events, where particles intersect cells, and wavefront events, where one of the particles in the wavefront exceeds the maximum error metric.\nParticle events merely transfer particles from their current cell to the intersected cell, which changes their speed and the rate at which they accumulate error. Wavefront events chop new cells out of the fluid.\nFigure 20 shows what the event queue might look like for the previous example of the 213 problem at time t = 0, if we assume that the wavefront w23 would chop out a new cell at time t = 1.5. For simplicity, we show only the events associated with wavefront w23. In a real simulation there would be a wavefront between each pair of cells, so the event queue would be much more cluttered.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 20.  Simulation event queue.Queue of events associated with wavefront w23 in the previous example of the 213 problem. Events are ordered by increasing time, and the simulator always executes the event at the head of the queue.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g020The first event transfers particle pl from c2 to c1. The second event uses wavefront w23 to chop a new cell out of the fluid. The third event is removed at the same time the second event is processed, since a wavefront’s tracer particles are removed in the chopping process.\nHere is how we determine the event times. When we create a wavefront with its pair of tracer particles, we find the intersection time tintersection of each particle with the nearest cell edge in its direction of travel, and the time tmax error when the error metric of each particle will exceed the maximum error metric. Figure 21 shows all four of these times for particles pl and pr in wavefront w23.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 21.  Particle intersection time and maximum error time.This figure shows all four possible event times for a single wavefront. Consider a fluid divided into four cells c1, c2, c3, and c4. Wavefront w23 contains particles pl and pr. Particle pl intersects cell c1 at time tintersection l, and reaches the maximum error metric at tmax error l. Particle pr intersects cell c4 at time tintersection r, and reaches the maximum error metric at tmax error r.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g021We enqueue the two tracer particles as events, using the intersection times as the event times. We also enqueue the wavefront as an event, using the soonest of the max error times as the event time.(18)\nEach time we pull an event off the event queue, we check whether the event is a particle intersecting a cell, or a wavefront whose particle is reaching the maximum error metric. If a particle has intersected a cell, we transfer it into the intersected cell, recalculate the event time, and requeue the particle.\nIf either particle in a wavefront has reached the maximum error metric, we union the wavefront with any overlapping wavefronts, chop and flatten the area of the union into a new cell, and insert the new cell into the fluid. Then we create a new wavefront for each edge of the new cell and insert the corresponding events into the event queue. Finally, we transfer any particles caught in the chopped-out area into the new cell, which changes their speeds to the local speed of sound in the new cell, recalculates their event times, and requeues them.\n\n\nRRM Algorithm Flowchart\nFor reference, figure 22 is a flowchart that outlines the entire RRM algorithm.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 22.

The two match closely in most cases, with some exceptions discussed below.\nIn the following tests, RRM typically uses a maximum of 200 to 400 cells during the simulation, depending on the maximum error metric we set. Most of those cells are concentrated in areas of high gradient, with only a few wide cells in flat areas. We set the maximum error metrics to obtain good results in a relatively short time. In the error analysis section that follows these test results, we will justify our choices of these maximum error metrics and show how the quality of the results varies as the maximum error metrics are varied.\n\nTest 1\nFigure 23 shows test 1, which is Sod’s problem [3] with the initial conditions (ρl, ul, pl) = (1.0, 0.0, 1.0) and (ρr, ur, pr) = (0.125, 0.0, 0.1). The maximum error metrics for ρ, u, and p are (Δmax ρ, Δmax u, Δmax p) = (1.0e-5, 1.0e-3, 1.0e-3). The results are for time t = 1.5.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 23.  Test 1: Sod’s test problem at high accuracy.Sod’s problem with initial conditions (ρl, ul, pl) = (1.0, 0.0, 1.0) and (ρr, ur, pr) = (0.125, 0.0, 0.1), with maximum error metric (Δmax ρ, Δmax u, Δmax p) = (1.0e-5, 1.0e-3, 1.0e-3), at time t = 1.5. This test shows typical RRM results: an s-shaped contact because RRM is not adiabatic across contacts, and a slight peak at the shock due to finite shock thickness.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g023These results are typical of RRM, and match the Riemann solver’s results closely with two exceptions: the s-shaped contact, and the slight peak where the shock shows a finite thickness.\nThe s-shaped contact occurs because unlike a Riemann solver, RRM is not adiabatic across contacts, and models heat diffusion as a side effect of the algorithm. Wavefronts are created at contacts the same as at any other cell edges, so new cells are created across contacts, and gradual diffusion is the result.\nWe could easily make RRM adiabatic across contacts by adding a rule that when a tracer particle reaches a contact, its error metric is set to the maximum. This would insure that new cells are always created on one side of the contact or the other, keeping the contact sharp. We have not tried this yet, so RRM’s current behavior is more like a real fluid than a Riemann solver in this respect.\nShocks in RRM have a finite thickness that manifests as a thin peak at the shock front. The shock thickness decreases as the accuracy is increased. This is because RRM creates new cells at the shock front at a rate proportional to the accuracy, and the more frequently cells are created there, the more quickly the change in density, velocity, and pressure is propagated to the area behind the shock. In the limit of infinite accuracy, the shock would be infinitely thin as it is in the Riemann solver’s results.\nShocks in a real fluid also have a finite thickness of a few mean free paths, for a similar reason. It takes fluid atoms or molecules a few collisions to transition from their state in front of the shock to their state behind the shock. But because real fluids are not continuous, the shock thickness at a given set of conditions is essentially fixed by the fluid’s physical properties.\nUnlike contacts, shocks in RRM will always be sharply defined, because they are formed by the edge of a supersonic cell pushing into slower fluid. Our wavefronts always travel at the local speed of sound a, so shocks are naturally self-forming because nearby wavefronts cannot outrun them.\n\n\nTest 2\nFigure 24 shows test 2, which is a modified version of Sod’s problem due to Laney [19]. This problem has a 100-to-1 pressure differential instead of the 10-to-1 differential of Sod’s problem. The initial conditions are (ρl, ul, pl) = (1.0, 0.0, 1.0) and (ρr, ur, pr) = (0.01, 0.0, 0.01). The maximum error metric is (Δmax ρ, Δmax u, Δmax p) = (1.0e-4, 1.0e-4, 1.0e-3), and the results are for time t = 1.5.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 24.

This test shows that RRM still gives good results on a problem that has a 100-to-1 pressure differential instead of the 10-to-1 differential of Sod’s problem.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g024This test shows that RRM can handle strongly supersonic flows. We can see that the contact is s-shaped as usual, and there is just a hint of a u peak at the shock front, but otherwise the results are in agreement with the Riemann solver. The velocity at the shock front is higher than in the original Sod’s problem, as we expect due to the greater pressure differential.\n\n\nTest 3\nFigure 25 shows test 3, which is a modified version of Sod’s problem where the entire fluid moves right with u = 1.0.

The shock is of increased thickness due to the lower accuracy, and is “blown back” from the correct location.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g033At this accuracy, the widths of the fluid cells are directly visible in the jagged curve of the expansion fan, and the contact is mostly smeared out. As expected, the shock thickness is greater due to the decreased accuracy. The shock front is also “blown back” so that it trails a constant distance behind the correct location. This is because the shock in RRM is a dynamic phenomenon with no special-case code. If the accuracy is not set high enough, fluid will pile up at the shock front where it cannot be redistributed fast enough to maintain the correct wave shape.\nFigure 34 shows test 1 yet again, but with the accuracy further reduced by increasing the maximum error metric to (Δmax ρ, Δmax u, Δmax p) = (1.0e-2, 1.0e-2, 1.0e-2) to show a more extreme failure.

The shock is even thicker due to the lower accuracy, and is “blown back” even farther from the correct location.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g034The jagged expansion fan is even more pronounced here, since the cells are even larger. The contact is completely gone, the shock is blown back even further, and the spike at the shock front is even higher, since more fluid is piled up there.\nOf course, we would never run a real simulation at such low accuracy. These figures are merely to show how the weaknesses of RRM differ from those of other methods. In particular, though RRM is a conservative method, that alone is does not guarantee correct shock placement as it does in FDM and FVM. But shocks in RRM remain very sharp even at very low accuracy, and there are no Gibbs oscillations near the shocks. This is because our cells are a piecewise-linear representation of the primitive variable values of the fluid.\nNow we present a more quantitative analysis. We define.(19)to be the vector error between the primitive variable values in RRM’s solution and the primitive variable values in the Riemann solver’s solution. Then we define a maximum integral error norm(20)to represent the maximum value, from the start time to some chosen end time, of the spatial integral of the norm of the error e(x,t) over the whole fluid.\nNote that we choose the maximum integral error norm instead of the simpler maximum error norm.(21)because the maximum error norm for RRM is typically the thin peak right at the shock front, which is of almost constant height (though decreasing thickness) as simulation accuracy is increased.\nFigure 35 shows emaxinorm and the maximum number of cells nmax vs. the maximum density error metric Δmax ρ for Sod’s problem.

This figure shows that the error decreases logarithmically as the number of cells (and thus the computational effort) increases logarithmically.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g035We can see that once Δmax ρ gets smaller than about 1.5e-4, the maximum number of cells in the simulation (which is a good proxy for the computational effort required) increases rapidly to maintain the approximately logarithmic decrease in maximum integral error norm. This computational effort goes into squaring off the contact, which is inherently diffusive in RRM.\nSince emaxinorm is integrated over a width of 10, emaxinorm = 0.1 corresponds to an average absolute density error of 0.01, or about 1%. But the error is not evenly distributed. Most of the error is around the s-shaped contact, with a lesser amount near the shock front due to the transition region.\nFigure 36 shows emaxinorm and the maximum number of cells nmax vs. the maximum velocity error metric Δmax u for Sod’s problem.

This is because the velocity gradient across the contact is small, so decreasing Δmax u will not cause more cells to be created there.\nFigure 37 shows emaxinorm and the maximum number of cells nmax vs. the maximum pressure error metric Δmax p for Sod’s problem.

Again, this is because there is little pressure gradient across the contact, so reducing Δmax p cannot improve the contact shape.\nFigure 38 shows emaxinorm and the maximum number of cells nmax vs. all three maximum error metrics Δmax ρ, Δmax u, and Δmax p for Sod’s problem.

All three maximum error metrics are swept from 1.0e-1 to 1.0e-5 in tandem. Simulation was from time t = 0.0 to t = 1.5. This figure shows that there is a slight synergistic effect between the three maximum error metrics, since the minimum error achieved here is slightly lower than when each of the three is set to 1.0e-5 individually.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g038This last graph shows that if all three maximum error metrics are decreased together, we can get a bit less error than if they are decreased separately. This indicates that there is some interaction between their effects, though it is small for this test case.\nTaken together, the previous four figures demonstrate that for this particular test case, RRM’s error decreases almost logarithmically as Δmax ρ is decreased logarithmically, whether by itself or in combination with the other maximum error metrics. However, other tests are sensitive to different maximum error metrics. For example, test 5 is sensitive to Δmax u, because its solution has velocity features near the origin that are far from the largest density or pressure gradients.\nThe maximum number of cells used by the simulation goes up almost logarithmically as the maximum error metrics are decreased logarithmically. And since the current RRM implementation performs O(n) operations per new cell created, where n is the number of cells in the fluid, this implies that the computational effort goes up logarithmically as well. This restricted our ability to run simulations with more than about 1000 cells in a reasonable time, which we define to be less than 5 minutes on one core of a 2.4 GHz Intel Core2 Quad CPU.\nFuture RRM implementations could perform as few as O(log n) or even O(1) operations per new cell created, if they used a more sophisticated data structure for cell intersection. We have so far avoided improving this data structure, since it makes the code much more difficult to maintain and alter for research purposes.\nA note on the error-reducing efficiency of Δmax ρ, Δmax u, and Δmax p in RRM is appropriate here. In the sweeps of Δmax u and Δmax p above, we see that the integral error norm decreases by fewer orders of magnitude than the number of cells increases by. This may simply show that decreasing the maximum error metrics of velocity and pressure does not efficiently reduce an error which is mostly in the density near the contact. Indeed, it appears that reducing Δmax ρ reduces the integral error norm more efficiently, by approximately one order of magnitude as the number of cells increases from 100 to 1000. But for fewer than 100 cells, the error-reducing efficiency of Δmax ρ is not as great. Overall, the error-reducing efficiency of the maximum error metrics in RRM is not yet fully understood.\nThese results indicate that RRM requires some further refinement if it is to efficiently produce results at any desired precision. If we assume the RRM implementation can be improved so that it performs only O(1) operations per cell, we would still like to insure that the number of cells always increases at a rate slower than the integral error norm decreases. One possibility is to adapt RRM to produce results more like those of a Riemann solver. As mentioned earlier, it would be straightforward to split new cells across contacts to maintain their sharpness, which would reduce a major source of error. Another possibility is to attempt to develop a new analytical solution to the Riemann problem that incorporates heat diffusion across contacts, and measure RRM’s error against that instead.\n\n\nConservation Error Analysis\nConservation error is the difference between the conserved quantities currently present in all cells, and the original conserved quantities at the start of the simulation, assuming any boundary effects are properly accounted for. We define one conservation error for each conserved quantity:(22)where Mf(t) is the total fluid mass, Pf(t) is total fluid momentum, and Ef(t) is total fluid energy, all functions of time.\nFigure 39 shows the three conservation errors for Sod’s problem over the first five seconds of flow time, at a time resolution of 0.01 seconds.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 39.

This graph shows that mass, momentum and energy are all conserved to within about ±6.0e-14. Total mass in the simulation is 11.25 kg, total momentum is 0.0 m·s, and total energy is 27.5 J.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g039This graph shows that mass, momentum and energy are all conserved to within about ±6.0e-14. Total mass in the simulation is 11.25 kg, total momentum is 0.0 m·s, and total energy is 27.5 J.\nThe first detail to note about this graph is that the conservation error is roughly two orders of magnitude larger than the floating-point precision εfp, which on our test machine is about 2.22e-16 for 64-bit IEEE floating point.\nThis is due to our use of the primitive variable form of the Euler equations in the current RRM implementation. The conserved quantities are derived from the primitive variable values of cell width, density, velocity, and pressure in a series of floating-point operations, each of which may be incorrect by roughly εfp. It takes only a few multiplicative operations for the error to grow to the observed value. Fortunately, since the signs of the individual errors are essentially random, the overall error does not tend to grow over time.\nIf we instead used the conservation form of the Euler equations in the RRM implementation, with a careful treatment we could get the error down to a smaller multiple of εfp. But since the error is already small in an absolute sense and does not grow over time, we chose to stay with the primitive variable form because it is simpler to code.\nThe second detail to note about the conservation error graph is the overall trends of the lines. The mass and energy lines are as expected, with floating-point truncation error causing random fluctuation about the horizontal axis. However, the momentum line differs, showing instead a fluctuation around approximately emomentum = 0.5e-14.\nThis is due to the initial conditions and time evolution of Sod’s problem. At time t = 0, the density and pressure are between 0.1 and 1.0, and calculating with these numbers to get mass and energy results in some nonzero error. However, the initial velocities are exactly zero, so initially emomentum will also be exactly zero. As the simulation proceeds and cell velocities increase, the effective baseline of emomentum is raised, since the calculations leading to momentum are no longer involve exact values of zero. Other test problems show variations on this behavior, but no problems tested so far show any time trend in conservation error.\n\n\nOther Boundary Conditions\nSo far we have considered only periodic boundary conditions, which are simple to implement since they do not affect the conserved quantities of the fluid. But RRM can handle many other types of boundary conditions by adjusting the conserved quantities of each new cell just before it is flattened. We will illustrate three more types of boundary conditions: solid, Dirichlet, and free.\nSolid boundaries are immovable and impermeable. To make a solid boundary, we check if each new cell touches or crosses the boundary. If so, we set its momentum to zero, and adjust its width so its edge just touches the boundary. Figure 40 shows Sod’s problem with solid boundaries at x = −5 and x = 5, from time t = 0 to t = 20. The initial conditions are (ρl, ul, pl) = (1.0, 0.0, 1.0) and (ρr, ur, pr) = (0.125, 0.0, 0.1). The maximum error metric is (Δmax ρ, Δmax u, Δmax p) = (1.0e-4, 1.0e-2, 1.0e-2).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 40.

The shock wave hits the right boundary, reflects off it, and travels back across the fluid until it reflects off the left boundary.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g040We can see the shock wave hit the right boundary, reflect off it, and travel back across the fluid until it reflects off the left boundary. If we let the simulation run indefinitely, the shock will travel back and forth many times, until numerical dissipation finally smooths it out. Eventually, the density and pressure will be flat, and the velocity will be everywhere zero.\nDirichlet boundaries hold the primitive variable values of the fluid constant at the boundaries. To make a Dirichlet boundary, we check if each new cell touches or crosses a boundary. If so, we set its density, velocity, and pressure to some constant boundary values, and adjust its width so its edge just touches the boundary. Figure 41 shows an inrush problem with Dirichlet boundaries at x = −5 and x = 5, from time t = 0 to t = 10.

If we let the simulation run longer, the continuous fluid inflow fills the area higher and higher, with velocity everywhere zero, and density and pressure eventually becoming flat due to diffusion.\nFree boundaries let fluid flow in or out of the boundaries, without creating any disturbance that might propagate back into “interesting” parts of the fluid. To make a free boundary, we check if each new cell touches or crosses a boundary. If so, we set its density, velocity, and pressure to those of the intersected cell nearest the boundary (for inflow) or farthest from the boundary (for outflow), and adjust its width so its edge just touches the boundary.

Rightward flow problem with far-field boundaries at x =  −5 and x = 5.A rightward flow problem with free boundaries at x = −5 and x = 5, from time t = 0 to t = 15. The initial conditions are (ρl, ul, pl) = (0.8, 0.8, 0.1) and (ρr, ur, pr) = (0.1, 0.7, 0.05). The maximum error metric is (Δmax ρ, Δmax u, Δmax p) = (5.0e-5, 1.0e-4, 1.0e-4). Fast-moving fluid flows in from the left boundary and pushes the slower fluid in front of it, forcing it out of the right boundary. After about t = 14 all of the fluid is in the left state, since all the right fluid as been pushed out.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039999.g042We can see that fast-moving fluid flows in from the left boundary and pushes the slower fluid in front of it, forcing it out of the right boundary. After about t = 14 all of the fluid is in the left state, since all the right fluid as been pushed out. Note that when the shock hits the right boundary at about t = 4, we can see a glitch. This is because if a cell is near the edge of the fluid, and there is no other cell between it and the edge, we extend it to touch the edge. In this case, it just happens to catch a narrow cell in the transition region and widen it so it is visible.\nFinally, we mention two details that apply to all three boundary condition types discussed above. First, when producing 3D graphs of RRM simulations, we remove the very thin cells that can occur in the transition regions at shock fronts. This is simply to make the graphs more legible, since otherwise these very thin cells hide the details of the fluid behind them. You can see one of these cells at t = 4 on the right side of the very last graph above.\nSecond, we note that these adjustments to the conserved quantities of new cells require us to change the stored initial conserved quantities of the entire fluid by a commensurate amount, so the simulation will not fail its ongoing per-event conservation checks. This models the mass, momentum, and energy that are being added and removed at the boundaries.\n\n\nSource Terms\nOur analysis so far has only treated the Euler equations in the homogeneous case, where no mass, momentum, or energy are added to or removed from the fluid during the simulation, except for a special case at the boundaries.\nIn the more general case, we augment the Euler equations with source terms thus:(23)using a new vector of source terms\n(24)Presenting a scheme to simulate these equations is beyond the scope of this paper. However, we can make a few remarks about how it might be possible.\nA few cases would be simple. For example, mass or energy source terms that are constant in space and time could easily be implemented by adding mass or energy to new cells during flattening.\nA few more cases are somewhat difficult, but feasible using splitting schemes similar to those described in chapter 15 of Toro’s book [1]. For example, momentum source terms that are constant in space and time could be implemented by changing the cells’ equations of motion from constant-velocity to varying-velocity, at the cost of complicating the intersection calculation of particles with cells.\nThe general case becomes very difficult. If spatially- and temporally-varying source terms are allowed, cells’ masses and energies could change in ways that would require both space and time integration to resolve at flattening time. The intersection calculation of particles with cells would also require solving ordinary differential equations, rather than simple algebraic equations.\n\nSo far we have shown that RRM gives correct results for many standard test problems, that RRM’s error decreases steadily as we increase the desired accuracy, and that RRM handles many common types of boundary conditions. Now we explain the similarities and differences between RRM and other CFD methods in detail, list some of RRM’s limitations, and suggest directions for future research.Simple CFD methods advance time across the whole fluid in lockstep. But this wastes effort in smooth areas of the fluid, and gives suboptimal resolution in steep areas. To solve this problem, Osher and Sanders proposed locally varying time steps [20]. Such methods can make simulation much more efficient, but they require that special care be taken at the interfaces between areas of differing time resolution.Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) methods such as the one proposed by Berger and Oliger [21] flag points in the fluid with high estimated error for possible refinement. Then every so often, the flagged points are clustered together to determine the size, shape, and orientation of a new, finer sub-mesh to cover them. Finer sub-meshes are integrated using proportionately shorter time steps, so AMR is adaptive in both space and time. AMR requires special care when integrating the sub-meshes, to insure that the boundary conditions with the rest of the fluid maintain conservation.RRM does not divide the fluid into areas of different mesh fineness or time step size. Instead, each new cell is created at its own individually chosen time, which need not bear any relation to the creation times of other cells. This gives us a very fine-grained spatio-temporal adaptivity, with the disadvantage that such a simulation must use an event queue instead of a simple time-stepping loop. RRM does not require a clustering algorithm, since new cells are preferentially created in high-gradient areas. But RRM does require the unioning of wavefronts before creating a new cell, which is a similar operation.RRM differs from FDM and FVM in that it does not use numerical derivatives in the cell chopping and flattening process, only integrals. This means that RRM does not need a flux limiter or slope limiter to smooth spurious oscillations that can be caused by the extremely large gradients near shocks.RRM differs from LBM firstly in that RRM is meshfree and Lagrangian, where LBM has a mesh (though it is called a lattice in LBM literature) and is Eulerian (since the fluid flows through fixed lattice sites). A more interesting difference between RRM and LBM is that in RRM, cells are free to move in any direction, where in LBM, fluid can only move in a fixed number of directions between adjacent sites. Fluid flows in LBM can therefore exhibit anisotropies, depending on the choice of lattice type and connectivity.Cells in 2D and 3D RRM will have angular velocity, which will complicate the flattening process somewhat, where in LBM the collision process is much the same for all dimensionalities. Since collision takes place only at zero-size lattice sites, angular quantities do not arise, which keeps the programming simpler than RRM.To adapt to the time-varying features of a fluid, a meshed Lagrangian method can move the mesh relative to the fluid, change the mesh connectivity, or both.The Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method (ALE) [22] combines the Eulerian and Lagrangian forms by creating a third “referential” coordinate system that is independent of both the fixed world coordinates and the moving material coordinates. This allows cells to move independently of both the fixed coordinate system and the material.As an ALE simulation progresses in Lagrangian mode, the cells can be “rezoned” by allowing the mesh to move relative to the fluid, while keeping the same mesh connectivity. This rezoning helps keep the cells from becoming tangled or degenerate, which would prevent further simulation. Rezoning is an Eulerian process, since it allows fluid to flow across cell edges, and it can smear out contacts and shocks unless one is careful when rezoning near them. For this reason, if the fluid motion is complex enough, it may be impossible to keep the original mesh connectivity without unacceptably degrading accuracy.The “free Lagrange” methods such as FLAG [23] and Whitehurst’s signal method [18] allow mesh points to be dynamically linked and unlinked over the course of the simulation, thereby changing the initial mesh connectivity as the fluid moves. These methods use a variety of heuristics to maintain a reasonable mesh, such as trying to keep nearest neighboring points connected, or trying to keep the angles of mesh triangles as equal as possible.In RRM, there is no mesh connectivity, so there is no need to track or alter it over the course of simulation. RRM constantly creates new cells, which has an effect similar to rezoning in that it allows fluid to flow across the edges of chopped cells.Moving finite element (MFE) methods [24]–[27] generalize the finite element method to better track moving fluid flow features using moving elements. MFE methods result in extremely stiff systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and so require sophisticated implicit ODE solvers. They also require careful tuning with user-chosen parameters to keep the elements from becoming too small or bunching up at shocks. It is also possible to adaptively create and destroy nodes in an MFE method, as shown by Kuprat in 1992 [28].Since each new RRM cell chops out and replaces what was underneath it, cells can never bunch up, and there is only one user-chosen parameter to set, the maximum error metric (though this metric does have three components). And since RRM does not use systems of equations, it does not need numerical solvers.Of all current CFD methods, the meshfree methods are the most similar to RRM. Indeed, we categorize RRM itself as a meshfree method, since it shares the characteristics of being purely Lagrangian and not using a mesh. But as we will see, there are many differences between previous meshfree methods and RRM in how cells or particles are formed, how their motion is calculated, and how long they persist during a simulation.Previous meshfree methods and RRM both discretize a fluid into a set of particles or cells with no connectivity between them. In previous meshfree methods like SPH and MPS, the particles are acted upon by forces over time, and thus change their velocities. In contrast, once a cell is created in RRM, it moves at a constant velocity even as parts of it are chopped away by the creation of subsequent new cells. This means RRM does not require integration of the equations of motion of its cells.A major difference between RRM and SPH or MPS lies in how the primitive variable values like density and pressure are determined at each point in the fluid. SPH and MPS store the conserved quantities in moving material particles. These particles have zero extent, but a smoothing function allows us to find the primitive variable values in the spaces between the particles. In contrast, RRM does not store the conserved quantities of the fluid directly. Instead, they are the result of integrating the stored primitive variable values over the cell areas. Since the cells have non-zero sizes, and new cells are constantly being created to fill any gaps, we do not need a smoothing function. The tracer particles in RRM are non-material particles that do not carry any conserved quantities, they simply trace out the expanding acoustic waves in the fluid.A particle-based meshfree method like SPH can be made adaptive by allowing the smoothing length to vary inversely with density, as shown by Benz in 1990 [29]. This is refined by Owen et al. in 1998 [30] to give each particle a time-varying, anisotropic smoothing length that attempts to keep the number of neighboring particles the same in each direction.The motion of the tracer particles in RRM gives an effect similar to the use of anisotropic smoothing length in adaptive SPH, since the tracer particles sweep out an area that varies with the local speed of sound and the local fluid motion.SPH can also be made adaptive by splitting and merging particles during simulation [31]–[33]. Splitting is done in low-density areas, and merging in high-density areas, to insure that the number of particles is appropriate to accurately track the fluid motion.The previous meshfree method most similar to RRM is the Finite Mass Method (FMM) [34], [35]. FMM divides the fluid into finite-sized cells (called mass packets in FMM papers) with an internal distribution typically described by third-order B-splines. These cells can move, deform, and interact during simulation. If the cells become too deformed, the simulation is stopped, the fluid is remeshed into new, undeformed cells and the simulation is restarted.Cells in RRM do not change shape, except in that parts of them are chopped away by the creation of new cells. Therefore RRM does not need to remesh to fix excessive cell deformation. RRM constantly creates and destroys cells, so any excessive bunching or gapping due to cell movement is fixed incrementally rather than all at once in a remeshing operation.RRM should work for most systems of conservation equations that have a complete wave description, which are often described as hyperbolic. In one dimension, such a system typically has three types of waves: entropy waves, left-propagating acoustic waves, and right-propagating acoustic waves. In RRM, the motions of the cells model the entropy waves, and the moving tracer particles model the propagation of the acoustic waves.RRM’s tracer particle methodology is useful only for compressible fluids, since incompressible fluids have no acoustic waves. So for example, RRM should work for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, but not the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.RRM’s “chop out and flatten” methodology is most applicable to systems that are locally conservative. A system that is globally conservative but not locally conservative cannot easily be chopped out and flattened, since the flattening would require access to parts of the fluid other than those that were chopped out.One limitation of RRM is that its data structures are complex and difficult to code correctly. Allowing cells to move and be chopped up over time is straightforward, but involves extra bookkeeping that many other methods do not require. Extension to 2D and 3D is possible, but will be even more complex since cells must be allowed to rotate as well as translate.Another limitation of RRM is its use of event-driven simulation. This gives good spatial and temporal adaptivity, but it makes the algorithm more difficult to parallelize, especially on GPGPUs (General-Purpose Graphics Processing Units) such as NVIDIA’s Tesla where data-dependent branching is penalized.A final limitation applies to von Neumann boundary conditions. Since RRM does not use spatial derivatives, it is difficult to hold them constant at the fluid boundaries. RRM could implement von Neumann boundary conditions with some difficulty by creating “ghost cells” just outside the boundaries to give the correct behavior, but it would not fit neatly into the “adjusting the conserved quantities of new cells” paradigm discussed in the above section on boundary conditions.The obvious future research directions for RRM are extension to 2D and 3D, replacement of the Euler equations with the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, and parallelization. A not-so-obvious direction is using RRM to simulate the behavior of non-fluid fields containing inherent discontinuities or intractable nonlinearity. Since RRM does not evaluate numerical derivatives or solve systems of equations, it might be applicable to fields whose traditional discretizations are numerically ill-behaved or difficult to formulate.RRM could also benefit from further investigation into its rate of convergence. As noted at the end of the section on absolute error, increases in computational effort do not always result in proportional decreases in the integral error norm. More research into this area would be helpful to insure that RRM can efficiently achieve any desired level of error."

            "fulltext": "IntroductionMagnetohydrodynamics is the study of flow of electrically conducting fluids in electric and magnetic fields. This phenomenon is essentially one of the mutual interaction between the fluid velocity and electromagnetic field i.e. the motion of the fluid affects the magnetic field and the magnetic field affects the fluid motion. Basically, magnetohydrodynamics is a research area that involves the study of motion of electrically conducting fluids such as plasma and salt water. MHD flows are found to have influential applications in many natural and man made flows. They are frequently used in industry to heat, pump, stir and levitate liquid metals. Another application for MHD is the magnetohydrodynamic generator in which electrically conducting fluid is used to generate electric power. The flows of an electrically conducting fluid in the presence of a magnetic field have important applications in various areas of technology such as, accelerators centrifugal separation of solid from fluid, purification of crude oils, astrophysical flows, petroleum industry, polymer technology, solar power technology, nuclear engineering applications and other industrial areas [1], [2].\nThe literature on the study of MHD viscous fluid is abundant (see for example [3]-[10] and the references therein). However, such studies for non-Newtonian fluids are limited. To the best of author's knowledge, MHD flow of non-Newtonian fluids was first studied by Sarpkaya [11]. Subsequently, several other investigations considering the MHD flow of non-Newtonian fluids were carried out and currently this field has become an active area of research. Ersoy [12] examined the MHD flow between eccentric rotating disks for an Oldroyd-B fluid. Hayat and Hutter [13] obtained exact solutions for flows of an electrically conducting Oldroyd-B fluid over an infinite oscillatory plate in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. Khan et al [14] developed exact solutions of Stokes second problem for MHD Oldroyd-B fluid. Liu et al [15] and Zheng et al [16] and [17] analyzed the MHD flow of generalized Oldroyd-B fluid for different fluid motions using frictional derivatives. On the other hand, studies on MHD flow of Burgers' fluid are very limited. Therefore, any MHD analysis of this model will be genuine contribution towards the enhancement of the theory of non-Newtonian fluid mechanics. Hayat et al. [18] studied the MHD flow of Burger's fluid whereas with heat transfer analysis was investigated by Siddiqui et al. [19], [20]. Very recently, Khan et al [21] studied MHD flow of Burger's fluid and obtained exact solutions of Stokes' first problem by using the Laplace and Fourier sine transforms. The MHD flows of these fluid models and some other well known non-Newtonian fluids models such as second grade fluid [22]–[27], third grade fluid [28], Maxwell fluid [29], [30], generalized Burgers' fluid [31], [32], Micropolar fluid [33], [34], Walters-B liquid fluid [35], Jeffery fluid [36] and Nanofluid [37] are used to describe stress relaxation, shear thinning or shear thickening, normal stress effects, earth's mantle, asphalt and asphalt mixes, food products and soil, dilute polymeric solutions, hydrocarbons, paints and several other industrial and geomechanical fluids.\nKhan et al [38] extended the work of Fetecau et al [39] to the MHD flow of an Oldroyd-B fluid induced by the impulsive motion of a plate between two side walls perpendicular to the plate. The analytical solutions are carried out by using the Fourier sine and Laplace transforms. Vieru et al [40] determined exact solutions corresponding to the flow of a Burgers' fluid over a suddenly moved flat plate when the relaxation times satisfy the condition  or  They used the Laplace transform technique to find the expressions for velocity and shear stress fields which were reduced to the similar solutions for Newtonian and Oldroyd-B fluids as limiting cases. Recently, Khan et al [41] extended the work of Vieru et al [40] to the flow of a Burgers' fluid over an oscillatory moved flat plate. They used a similar method of solution and obtained the exact solutions.\nFrom the literature survey, it is found that there are very few problems of Newtonian fluids for which the exact solutions are available. However, these solutions become even more rare if the constitutive equations of non-Newtonian fluids are considered. The importance of exact solutions is not only that they can explain the physics of some fundamental flows but also that such solutions can be used as checks against complicated numerical codes that have been developed for much more complex flows. Moreover, one of the most common mistakes that has been overlooked for the last coupled of decades has been identified by Christov [42]. Christov pointed out that in the case of Stokes first and second problems, the plate's velocity is given by , where  denotes the Heaviside step function, and  is some smooth function. This inclusion of Heaviside step function was ignored previously. There are several comments and errata published in the literature for the modification of such erroneous results. It is important to mention here that such type of mistakes reported by Christov [42] are avoided in the present communication.\nThe main purpose of the present investigation is to extend the work of Vieru et al. [40] and Khan et al. [41] for the MHD flow of an electrically conducting Burgers' fluid past an oscillating plate when the magnetic field is acting perpendicular to the flow direction. It is also interesting to study the flow of non- Newtonian fluids with externally imposed magnetic fields which control the boundary layer and increase the performance of many systems. For example, when we use the electrically conducting fluid in MHD power generators, their performance increase in comparison to conventional electric generators where solid conductors are used to generate electric power. The present work can also be helpful to study underground oil, where there is a natural magnetic field and the motion of blood through arteries [43], [44].\nThe rest of the paper is arranged as follows. The governing equations of the problem are given in section 2. The mathematical formulation of the problem is given in Section 3.The solution of the problem is given in section where the Laplace transform technique is used and the expressions for velocity and shear stress fields are obtained when the relaxation time satisfies the condition  or Limiting solutions are given in section 5. Graphical results are displayed in section and discussed for the embedded flow parameters. This paper ends with some conclusions given in section \nGoverning EquationsThe unsteady incompressible flow of an electrically conducting fluid is governed by the following equations(1)(2)(3)where is the velocity vector, is the density of the fluid, is the pressure,is the the extra stress tensor, is the current density, is the total magnetic field where denotes the applied magnetic field and is the induced magnetic field, is the magnetic permeability, is the electric field and is the electrical conductivity of the fluid.\nThe extra stress tensor for non-Newtonian Burgers' fluid constitutes the following equation [40], [41](4)in whichis the dynamic viscosity,is the first Rivlin Ericksen tensor, is the velocity gradient,is the transpose of the velocity gradient,andare the relaxation and retardation times respectively and is the material constant of Burgers' fluid multiplies the upper second order convected time derivative of defined as(5)where is the material time derivative.\nFor the problem under consideration, we are looking for velocity and stress fields of the form(6)where is the -component of velocity field and is the unit vector in the -direction.\nIn order to calculate Lorentz force, it is assumed that the polarization effects are zero (, the magnetic field is applied in outward perpendicular direction to the flow and the induced magnetic field is negligible compare to the applied magnetic field under the assumption of small magnetic Reynolds number, is the strength of applied magnetic field. Thus in view of these assumptions and using Eq. (3), the Lorentz force becomes [21](7)\nThus using Eq. (6), the continuity Eq. is identically satisfied and the momentum Eq. (2) in the absence of a pressure gradient in the flow direction and Eq. (4) after using Eqs. and (7) and having in mind the initial conditions give the following governing equations(8)(9)where is the non-trivial shear stress.\nMathematical Formulation of the ProblemWe consider the unsteady incompressible flow of an electrically conducting Burgers' fluid occupying the upper half space of plane over a rigid flat plate. The axis is taken parallel to the flow direction whereas axis is taken normal to the plate. The magnetic field is applied in outward transverse direction to the flow. Initially, we assume that both fluid and plate are at rest. After time the plate begins to oscillate in its own plane and the fluid is gradually moved as shown in Fig. 1.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.

            "fulltext": "IntroductionA fundamental advance in the understanding of nature was the insight that physical forces between bodies, instead of operating at a distance, are generated by fields; the latter obeying their own dynamics, implying a finite speed of propagation of signals and causality [1]. Moreover, time-varying fields can sustain themselves in otherwise empty space to produce disembodied waves; exemplified by electromagnetic fields and waves, and gravitational fields. Gravitational waves are believed to be detected in the near future [2].\nAnother force seemingly operating at a distance is the Casimir force. This force was first predicted by Casimir in 1948 for two parallel conducting plates in vacuum, separated by a distance , for which he found an attractive force per unit area  [3]. It can be understood as resulting from the modification of quantum-mechanical zero-point fluctuations of the electromagnetic field due to confining boundaries [4]–[7]. In the last decade, high-precision measurements of the Casimir force have become available which confirm Casimir's prediction within a few per cent [8]–[11]; recent experiments demonstrate the possibility of using the Casimir force as an actuation force for movable elements in nanomechanical systems [10]–[12]. The thermal Casimir force, generated by thermal rather than quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field, has recently been confirmed [13]. This development goes along with significant advances in calculating the Casimir force for complex geometries and materials [7], [14]–[21]. A force analogous to the electromagnetic Casimir force occurs if the fluctuations of the confined medium are of thermal instead of quantum origin [5], [22], [23]. The thermal analog of the Casimir effect, referred to as critical Casimir effect, was first predicted by Fisher and de Gennes for the concentration fluctuations of a binary liquid mixture close to its critical demixing point confined by boundaries [24]; recently, the critical Casimir effect was quantitatively confirmed for this very system [25]. (For computational methods concerning the calculation of critical Casimir forces, see, e.g., Refs. [26]–[28].)\nThe vast majority of work done on the Casimir effect, and fluctuation-induced forces in general, pertain to the equilibrium case. That is, the system is in its quantal ground state in case of the electromagnetic Casimir effect, or in thermodynamic equilibrium in case of the thermal analog. A number of recent experiments probe the Casimir force between moving components in nanomechanical systems [10]–[12], and effects generated by moving boundaries have been studied, e.g., for Casimir force driven ratchets [29]; however, the data are usually compared with predictions for the Casimir force obtained for systems at rest, corresponding to a quasi-static approximation.\nDistinct new effects occur if the fluctuating medium is driven out of equilibrium. In this case the observed effects become sensitive to the dynamics governing the fluctuating medium, which may lead to a better understanding of these systems and may provide new control parameters to manipulate them [30]–[40]. The generalization of the electromagnetic Casimir effect to systems with moving boundaries, referred to as dynamic Casimir effect, exhibits friction of moving mirrors in vacuum and the creation of photons [41]–[44]. Related effects due to oscillating media [45], and nonequilibrium Casimir-Polder forces on moving atoms [46], have also been considered. Interesting effects occur if each body immersed in the fluctuating electromagnetic field is at a different temperature [47], [48]. The associated nonequilibrium Casimir forces and heat transfer between the bodies lead to observable effects [49], [50]. For the thermal analog, fluctuation-induced forces in non-equilibrium systems have been studied in the context of the Soret effect, which occurs in the presence of an external temperature gradient [31]. Effects of temperature changes in classical free scalar field theories and thermal drag forces have been studied in [32]–[35]; however, recently it was argued that the method presented in [32]–[35] is invalid to obtain the fluctuation-induced force exerted on an inclusion or plate embedded in the medium, whereas the stress tensor method, as used in the present work, yields the correct force [40]. Fluctuation-induced forces have also been obtained for macroscopic bodies immersed in mechanically driven systems [30], granular fluids [36], and reaction-diffusion systems [37]. Recently it was shown that non-equilibrium fluctuations can induce self-forces on single, asymmetric objects, and may lead to a violation of the action-reaction principle between two objects [38].\nIn this work we consider a correlated fluid driven out of equilibrium mechanically by a vibrating plate, and study the resulting fluctuation-induced, time-dependent force  on a second plate at rest. We wish to study the time-dependence of this force in view of the finite speed of diffusion of perturbations in the fluctuating medium, and causality. We consider the simplest possible dynamics of the medium between the plates, namely the purely relaxational dynamics of model A. Specifically, we consider two infinitely extended plates parallel to the -plane, where plate 1 is at rest while plate 2 is vibrating parallel to the -direction by some external driving, resulting in a time-dependent separation (see Fig. 1)(1)with amplitude  and driving frequency . The fluctuating medium is described by a non-conserved scalar order parameter field , corresponding to the critical dynamics of model A [51], [52], subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions  at the plates. The field  may describe the order parameter of a fluid thermodynamically close to a critical point, or a massless Goldstone mode arising from the breaking of a continuous symmetry such as in nematic liquid crystals or superfluid 4He [5], [22]. Our results hold in Gaussian approximation right at the critical point  for which the bulk correlation length  diverges. For  the fluctuation-induced force also depends on the finite correlation length . Moreover, for near-critical fluids and binary liquid mixtures the boundary conditions at confining walls correspond to the so-called normal rather than Dirichlet surface universality class [22]. However, it should be noted that dynamic critical behavior is less universal than equilibrium critical behavior. For example, for the liquid-gas transition and the demixing transition in a binary liquid mixture a conserved order parameter convects with the conserved transverse momentum current of the fluid, resulting in critical dynamics referred to as model H [53]; conversely, the superfluid transition of 4He corresponds to critical dynamics of model F [54]. In addition, critical dynamics of real fluids may be modified by effects due to gravity and the coupling of the order parameter to secondary densities, which further complicates a quantitative comparison of theory and experiment (see [51], [52] for reviews). Strictly speaking, purely relaxational dynamics of a non-conserved scalar order parameter corresponding to model A only applies to uniaxial magnetic systems and simple lattice gases. However, the results and conclusions derived here for model A dynamics yield new insight in non-equilibrium behavior and may serve as a starting point for more realistic models.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.  Geometry of two parallel plates separated by a varying distance . Plate 1 is at rest while plate 2 is vibrating parallel to the -direction. The plates are immersed in a fluctuating medium with purely relaxational dynamics described by a non-conserved scalar order parameter . The fluctuation-induced, time-dependent net force  on plate 1 is the sum of forces  and  acting on opposite sides of the plate.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0053228.g001Our results for the time-dependent force  on plate 1 hold to first order in  (cf. Eq. (1)). As shown in Fig. 1,  is the sum of forces  and  acting on opposite sides of the plate;  being the force acting on plate 1 from the side of the cavity, and  the (time-independent) force on the boundary surface of a semi-infinite half-space filled with the fluctuating medium. The net force  is expected to be finite and overall attractive, i.e., directed towards plate 2.\nResults\nRelaxational Dynamics\nIn traditional studies of the fluctuation-induced force between two plates, both plates are assumed to be at rest at constant separation  (see Fig. 1). The system is in thermal equilibrium and the fluctuations of the order parameter  are described by the statistical Boltzmann weight  with Gaussian Hamiltonian(2)where  with the Boltzmann constant  and the temperature  (assumed to be constant). The fluctuation-induced force  on plate 1 per unit area  is found to be [5], [22], [23](3)where the minus sign indicates that the force is attractive. Equation (3) is a universal result, independent of the underlying dynamics of the fluctuating medium, as long as the equilibrium is described by Eq. (2).\nWe now turn to the case where plate 2 is vibrating parallel to the -direction, resulting in a time-dependent separation  between the plates (see Eq. (1) and Fig. 1). The time-dependent boundary conditions for the order parameter  in the medium between the plates now drive the system out of equilibrium. Locally, the order parameter will relax back to equilibrium according to the dynamics of the medium; in this work, we consider a purely relaxational dynamics described by the Langevin equation (see, e.g., Chapter 8 in Ref. [55], and references cited therein)(4)where  is the friction coefficient. The random force  is assumed to have zero mean and to obey the fluctuation-dissipation relation(5)where the brackets  denote a local, stochastic average and  is the delta function in 3 dimensions.\n\n\nNon-Equilibrium Casimir Force\nThe force per unit area acting on plate 1 from the side of the cavity can be expressed as  where  are the components of  parallel to the plate and  is the -component of the stress tensor [6], [56] (see text below Eq. (104) in Ref. [56] for a discussion of the stress tensor in connection with critical dynamics). Similarly, the force per unit area acting on the other side of plate 1 is given by  where  is again evaluated in the cavity between the plates but for the limit  (see Fig. 1). The net force per unit area on plate 1 yields as(6)Using the Dirichlet boundary condition  at the plates we obtain(7)To calculate the two-point correlation function of  on the right-hand side of Eq. (7) we note that the solution  of Eq. (4) can be expressed as(8)where  is the volume of the cavity at time  and the Green's function  is defined as the solution of(9)subject to the boundary condition  whenever  or  is located on the surface of one of the plates (note that  is symmetric in  and ). In addition,  for  by causality. Thus,  can be expressed as a linear superposition of contributions from the source  at times  and positions , carried forward in time by the propagator . Using Eqs. (8) and (5) one finds the two-point correlation function(10)In the present set-up, the system is translationally invariant in -direction at any time , whereas translation invariance in time is broken due to the varying separation  between the plates. Thus, introducing the partial Fourier transform  of  as(11)the function  depends explicitly on one of the time coordinates in , say, . Using Eqs. (10), (11) we find for the expression in Eq. (7) (the star symbol indicates the complex conjugate for real-valued argument )(12)where(13)For given propagator , hence function ,  is obtained using Eqs. (6) and (12) (cf. Methods).\n\n\nDiffusion of Stress and Resonant Dissipation\nThe ratio  of the fluctuation-induced, time-dependent force  on plate 1 due to the vibrating plate 2 and the corresponding static force  is a universal (cutoff-independent) function of  (geometry),  (time-dependence of the driving), and the dimensionless parameter(14)(see Eqs. (1), (3), (4), and Fig. 1). Our results for  correspond to an expansion to first order in  and can be cast in the form(15a)where the dimensionless function  is normalized such that  for . For  the function  can be represented as(15b)in terms of an amplitude  and a phase shift .\nThe amplitude  is shown in Fig. 2. For , i.e., , the normalization  in conjunction with  (see below) implies . For , i.e., , the length  is a measure of the distance over which a perturbation diffuses during an oscillation. For increasing  a variation of stress generated at the vibrating plate 2 is more and more attenuated, i.e., washed out, due to the diffusive nature of the medium before it reaches plate 1; thus  is monotonically decreasing for increasing  (Fig. 2, black line).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 2.

For , i.e., , there is no contribution from resonant dissipation, thus  and  (however,  for  because ). For  the amplitude  is attenuated due to the diffusive nature of the medium as discussed in relation to  above; thus  is monotonically decreasing for increasing  (Fig. 2, red line). Finally, the amplitude  due to resonant dissipation is shown as the green line in Fig. 2. Resonant dissipation is absent in the static case , i.e., , which implies . For large  the amplitude  is attenuated due to the diffusive nature of the medium as discussed in relation to  above; thus  starts at , is increasing for small  and monotonically decreasing for large  (Fig. 2, green line).\nFigure 3 shows the phase shift  of the function  in Eq. (15b) in terms of the variable . Thus, using Eq. (14), , where the lag time  is a measure of the time a variation of stress generated at the vibrating plate 2 takes to diffuse through the medium to reach plate 1. For illustration, for  and  we obtain .  is fairly constant over a wide range of  and approaches a finite value  for  (Fig. 3a, black line); thus  as expected for the present diffusive dynamics in the medium between the plates. In the limit  the relation  with finite  implies . A qualitatively similar behavior occurs for the phase shift  of the function  in Eq. (17b) (Fig. 3a, red line). Finally, Fig. 3b shows the phase shift  of the function  in Eq. (18b); in this case,  itself is approximately constant and approaches a finite value for  (in contrast to , for which  is approximately constant, see above). This implies that the corresponding lag time  formally diverges for , i.e., , which reflects the fact that resonant dissipation is absent in the static case . However, the divergence of  for  is suppressed in the net force  since the amplitude  in Eq. (18b) vanishes for , so that the lag time  of  stays finite for  (see pone.0053228.e104Eq.

Our main results for , valid to first order in the amplitude  of the oscillations, are summarized in Figs. 2 and 3. We find two distinct contributions to  related to diffusion of stress in the fluid and resonant dissipation, respectively. Resonant dissipation has been studied for the dynamic Casimir effect of the electromagnetic field, where it is a result of enhanced creation of photons if the driving frequency corresponds to a resonance frequency of the cavity [41]–[44]. In the present case, dissipation is generated by the viscosity of the fluid described by the friction parameter  in the Langevin equation (4).\nFluctuation-induced forces may be observed, e.g., by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM). To avoid the experimental difficulty of keeping two flat plates parallel one usually employs geometries in which one of the surfaces is curved; for example, by measuring the force between a sphere attached to the tip of an AFM cantilever and a flat plate. The force  on a sphere of radius  separated by a distance  surface-to-surface from a flat plate is related to the energy of interaction per surface area  between two flat plates by the proximity force rule . For example, the static force per unit area  in Eq. (3) yields  PT for  K, ,  nm, which is readily accessible by AFM.\nFluctuation-induced forces between moving objects are expected to occur for any medium exhibiting long-ranged correlations. However, as mentioned in the Introduction, for real fluids the model needs to be modified to take into account conservation of the order parameter and its convection with the transverse momentum current of the fluid, thus treating Casimir and hydrodynamic interactions on the same footing (corresponding to the critical dynamics of model H [53]); these effects are important and will modify the result for  in pone.0053228.e104Eq. (15) obtained for the purely relaxational dynamics of model A (see [51], [52] for reviews on dynamic critical behavior and its comparison with experiments). However, the time-dependent force  predicted in pone.0053228.e104Eq. (15) may be observable by means of computer simulations of the ferromagnetic Ising model (or corresponding lattice gas models) confined between two plates, one of which is vibrating at small amplitude.\nA much-studied subject related to the present study are hydrodynamic interactions of microscopic objects in viscous fluids since they are relevant, e.g., to the motility and locomotion of swimming microorganisms [57]. Recently, motivated by devices such as the AFM, the drag experienced by a cylindrical object (modeling an AFM cantilever) and a sphere oscillating at small amplitude near a flat surface were studied in detail [58], [59]; however, few results are available concerning the hydrodynamic force generated by an oscillating object on a different object nearby. Thus, it would be interesting to probe effective hydrodynamic interactions between different, moving objects immersed in a viscous fluid, and how these interactions are modified by the Casimir force when correlations in the fluid become long-ranged.\nThe fluctuation-induced, time-dependent force  on plate 1 due to the vibrating plate 2 is universal in the sense that it is largely independent of microscopic details of the system. The force ratio , where  is the force at fixed separation , only depends on the dimensionless variables  (geometry),  (time-dependence of the driving), and  characterizing the viscosity of the fluid. It would be interesting to generalize our approach to the electromagnetic field to study the analogous, time-dependent Casimir force  for the dynamic Casimir effect of the electromagnetic field.\nThe calculation of the non-equilibrium Casimir force  by Eqs. (6) and (12) requires the propagator  solving Eq. (9) subject to the time-dependent boundary conditions due to the vibrating plate 2. This problem can be solved, for general modulations of the plate(s) in space and time, by the method developed in Refs. [60], [61]. For the present set-up, we find for the partial Fourier transform  of  (i.e., transforming the spatial coordinates ,  parallel to the plates as in Eq. (11) but keeping the time coordinates , ; in what follows, we omit the argument  for ease of notation) [60], [61](19)where  is the propagator in the half-space  bounded by a Dirichlet surface at  (that is, the function  itself is independent of the vibrating plate 2; the dependence of  on plate 2 in Eq. (19) only enters through the arguments ,  in , and the kernel ). The kernel  is defined by(20)In this work, we consider small variations of the separation between the plates about a mean separation , i.e.,(21)Our results hold to first order in . To this end, we insert Eq. (21) in Eq. (19) and expand everything to first order in  (note that  also enters the upper boundary of the integration over  in Eq. (12)). This results in expansions  and  of the functions  and  from Eqs. (11), (13) in powers of . Equations (6), (12) then yield the corresponding contributions to .Let us first consider the leading order, i.e.,  and . Using Eq. (19) and transforming to -space as in Eq. (11) we find (omitting the arguments  and  for ease of notation)(22)where  with  from Eq. (26) below and . Thus,(23)and, using Eq. (13),(24)Using Eqs. (6), (12), (24) we thus obtain to leading order [31](25a)(25b)The integral in Eq. (25b) is finite and yields Eq. (3). In Eq. (25a) we use(26)so that  if  is real. Integrations over  as in Eq. (25a) are readily computed by contour integration in the complex -plane. In Eq. (25a) and throughout this work we use the convention that in -integrations we integrate above the pole in ; this can be accomplished by the replacement  in the denominator of the integrand in Eq. (25a). The limit  in final results is always understood. Note that this prescription introduces a positive time direction and ensures causality.  has a branch cut along the negative imaginary axis , , whereas  has a branch cut along the positive imaginary axis , . The integral over  in Eq. (25a) has two contributions. For the contribution involving , the contour integral can be closed in the upper complex -plane (thus avoiding the branch cut of ), where this term has no poles, so that the contribution from this term vanishes. Likewise, for the contribution involving , the contour integral can be closed in the lower complex -plane (avoiding the branch cut of ), where, in turn, this term has no poles. The single pole at  in the lower complex -plane then yields the expression in Eq. (25b); cp. Fig. 4a with .We now turn to the contribution to  to first order in . Using the expansion(27)in Eq. (12), with  from Eq. (13) and  from Eq. (24), we find for general (28)where(29)The symbol  denotes a convolution of two functions ,  involving an insertion of :(30)For functions , , the expression  is the representation in -space of ; i.e., . The functions ,  are the representations in -space of , , respectively. Equations (28), (29) are obtained by using Eq. (19) with , expanding everything to first order in , and using Eq. (30) for the resulting insertions of . The contribution of  to first order in  is determined by Eq. (20), resulting in  where the subscripts 0 and 1 indicate the order in ;  is given below Eq. (22).For the special case that plate 2 is vibrating with harmonic oscillations of amplitude  and frequency  (see Eqs. (1), (21)), i.e.,(31)we obtain . The integral  in Eq. (28) decays into two contributions corresponding to the terms in square brackets on the right-hand side of Eq. (29):(32)where the subscripts QQ and QP indicate the contributions from the first and second term in square brackets of Eq. (29), respectively. In what follows we show that these two terms yield distinct contributions to  corresponding to real-valued and imaginary poles in the complex -plane.For the first contribution in Eq. (32) we find (the  symbol indicates the complex conjugate of the preceding expression; regarding the replacement  in the denominator of the integrand, see the discussion below Eq. (26))(33)where(34)with ,  from Eq. (26). Computing the right-hand side of Eq. (33) by contour integration in the complex -plane, the contributions from the two terms in square brackets in the integrand are analyzed along similar lines as discussed below Eq. (26). Thus, for the first term in square brackets, the contour integral can be closed in the upper complex -plane, where  has no poles, so that the contribution from this term vanishes. For the second term in square brackets, the contour integral can be closed in the lower complex -plane, where  has no poles. The only contribution from this term is from the single pole at ; see Fig. 4a. Thus, including the contribution from the complex conjugate in Eq. (33), we obtain(35)The corresponding contribution to  is given by  (see Eqs. (28) and (32)). In the static case, where  and  in Eq. (1), this result can also be obtained directly from Eq. (25b) by replacing  with  and expanding to first order in . For finite , Eq. (35) emerges from the static case by a shift from  to a finite value of . This shift may be understood in terms of a transition from stationary modes in the cavity in the static case to modes with a time-dependence  in response to the vibrating plate 2. The resulting fluctuation-induced force  on plate 1 is characterized by a finite lag time  which is a measure of the time a variation of stress in the medium generated at the vibrating plate 2 takes to diffuse through the medium to reach plate 1 (see Fig. 1). For the present diffusive dynamics,  is related to the distance  between the plates by .For the second contribution in Eq. (32) we find(36)The contour integral over  can be closed either in the upper or the lower complex -plane, yielding identical results; the contributions from the poles at  and  in the lower complex -plane cancel. Closing the contour integral in the lower plane, the integral picks up contributions from the imaginary poles  of , where  and  is a positive integer. Note that  has a branch cut along the negative imaginary axis on which the poles  are located (see the related discussion below Eq. (26)); however, this branch cut may be cured using the identity , with , which holds close to the negative imaginary axis. The expression  is analytic in the lower complex -plane with isolated poles at ; see Fig. 4b. Summing over the residues of these poles yields(37)The corresponding contribution to  is given by . Note that  is proportional to , which implies that this term is absent in the static case  and solely generated by the fact that the system is driven out of equilibrium by the vibrating plate 2 (see Fig. 1). The imaginary-frequency poles  leading to Eq. (37) are related to resonant dissipation in the cavity, where the spectrum of imaginary resonance frequencies  is continuous due to the presence of the continuous in-plane wave number  (compare the related discussion of resonant dissipation in the context of the dynamic Casimir effect of the electromagnetic field in Ref.

Resonant dissipation has been studied for the dynamic Casimir effect of the electromagnetic field, where it is a result of enhanced creation of photons if the driving frequency corresponds to a resonance frequency of the cavity [41]–[44]."

                "\n        The sound source of a voice is produced by the self-excited oscillation of the vocal folds. In modal voice production, a drastic increase in transglottal pressure after vocal fold closure works as a driving force that develops self-excitation. Another type of vocal fold oscillation with less pronounced glottal closure observed in falsetto voice production has been accounted for by the mucosal wave theory. The classical theory assumes a quasi-steady flow, and the expected driving force onto the vocal folds under wavelike motion is derived from the Bernoulli effect. However, wavelike motion is not always observed during falsetto voice production. More importantly, the application of the quasi-steady assumption to a falsetto voice with a fundamental frequency of several hundred hertz is unsupported by experiments. These considerations suggested that the mechanism of falsetto voice onset may be essentially different from that explained by the mucosal wave theory. In this paper, an alternative mechanism is submitted that explains how self-excitation reminiscent of the falsetto voice could be produced independent of the glottal closure and wavelike motion. This new explanation is derived through analytical procedures by employing only general unsteady equations of motion for flow and solids. The analysis demonstrated that a convective acceleration of a flow induced by rapid wall movement functions as a negative damping force, leading to the self-excitation of the vocal folds. The critical subglottal pressure and volume flow are expressed as functions of vocal fold biomechanical properties, geometry, and voice fundamental frequency. The analytically derived conditions are qualitatively and quantitatively reasonable in view of reported measurement data of the thresholds required for falsetto voice onset. Understanding of the voice onset mechanism and the explicit mathematical descriptions of thresholds would be beneficial for the diagnosis and treatment of voice diseases and the development of artificial vocal folds.\n      "

            "fulltext": "IntroductionThe self-excited oscillation of the vocal folds located at the larynx produces the major sound source of a voice [1]–[8]. This self-excitation is caused by the flow-structure interaction between respiratory airflow and vocal fold tissue. During self-excitation, airflow must provide the energy necessary for the development of vocal fold oscillation, otherwise, the vocal fold motion decays with time owing to frictional damping in the tissue [4], [5]. Van den Berg [9] provided the first mechanics-based explanation for the voice onset mechanism. He argued in his myoelastic-aerodynamic theory that a pressure drop across the constricted glottis (i.e., the flow path formed by a pair of vocal folds; see Fig. 1), which is created by the Bernoulli effect, sucks the vocal folds together and closes the glottis. Alternatively, the glottis may initially be closed only by laryngeal muscle contraction without the help of flow (see Fig. 2A, 1) [10]. A drastic increase in the subglottal pressure up to the lung pressure, accumulated beneath the closed glottis, pushes the vocal folds downstream and eventually opens the glottal width (Fig. 2A; 2, 3). The blown apart vocal folds are then able to return to their original position owing to an elastic restoring force because the surrounding air pressure at this stage must be relatively low due to the restart of the flow after the glottal opening (Fig. 2A; 3, 4), thereby creating repeated open-close movements. Thus, the vocal fold closure ensures a requirement for self-excitation, i.e., a continuous energy transfer from the flow to the vocal folds.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.

Relationship between the glottal pressure and vocal fold deformation.(A) The positive energy transfer from airflow to vocal fold motion with glottal closure or collision, previously submitted by van den Berg [9] as the myoelastic-aerodynamic theory. The inferior half of the glottis (dashed rectangular region in Fig. 1) is modeled. The theory suggests that the vocal folds are initially sucked together due to the Bernoulli effect. Alternatively, the vocal folds may initially be closed due to laryngeal muscle contraction without the help of the fluid (1). In either case, the glottal closure increases the subglottal pressure, resulting in upward deformation of the vocal folds (2). Here, the size of the letter P indicates the magnitude of the glottal pressure, and the dashed lines indicate the original position of the vocal folds. The pressure is more or less diminished due to the restart of the flow after the reopening of the glottis (3), which then allows the vocal folds to return to the original position due to elastic recoil (4). (B and C) Mucosal wave-based explanation for self-excitation of vocal fold motion without closure and the resultant drastic increase in the subglottal pressure. Net positive energy transfer is not achieved when a single degree of freedom model is employed (B) while it may be possible for a model with a degree of freedom of more than two (C). However, the schema (C) assumes a quasi-steady flow assumption, which is not applicable to a high frequency range such as that for a falsetto voice. For details, see the text.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0017503.g002Then, the question arises as to how glottal pressures asymmetric in magnitude over one oscillatory cycle (i.e., larger in the opening phase than in the closing phase, resulting in a net positive energy transfer) are created with no such glottal closure during vocal fold oscillations [5]. This requirement may not be satisfied in the absence of glottal closure because the Bernoulli effect, whose magnitude is determined by the absolute value of the width or cross-sectional area (but not its time rate of change), has the same value whether the glottis is opening or closing; therefore, the same pressure in magnitude may be applied to the vocal folds, resulting in the failure of developing oscillations (see Fig. 2B) [5]. Note that the vocal folds exhibit wavelike motion in the coronal plane during speech [9], [11]. On the basis of an analytical two-mass vocal fold model, Ishizaka and Matsudaira [1], [2] demonstrated that such wavelike motion or phase lag in motion between the upper and lower masses of the vocal folds led to self-excitation through flow-structure interaction (see Fig. 2C). Titze [4], [5] more explicitly highlighted the role of a mucosal wave while explaining that the vocal folds could experience higher pressure during the opening phase owing to the wavelike motion with the glottis opening at the bottom (upstream) first and then at the top (downstream) and likewise closing at the bottom first and then at the top (see Fig. 2C).\nThen, how are these theories related to the actual phonation involving two main vocal registers, i.e., modal and falsetto? In the modal register, oscillating vocal folds (observed with a laryngo-stroboscopy or high-speed camera) entirely close the glottis in each oscillation cycle while deforming with the entire body [9]. Therefore, the mechanism of the modal or normal voice with such pronounced glottal closure is basically explained by the myoelastic-aerodynamic theory (Fig. 2A), which is analogous to the airflow-induced buzzing of the lips that also results in an intermittent outflow [12]. In contrast, the vocal folds in the falsetto register often keep the glottis open while oscillating, through this opening a certain volume of airflow continuously escapes. The myoelastic-aerodynamic theory is not applicable to such oscillations without complete glottal closure (Fig. 2B) [5]. The pioneering analytical models, provided by Ishizaka and Matsudaira [1], [2] and by Titze [5] in the mucosal wave theory (Fig. 2C), were intended to elucidate the onset mechanism for such small amplitude oscillations without complete glottal closure. Then, does the mucosal wave theory describe the falsetto voice mechanism precisely? It is noteworthy that during falsetto phonation, the vocal folds do not always exhibit mucosal wave motions [9], [13]–[19]. The main body of each fold, which consists of the thyroarytenoid muscle, is more or less relaxed in falsetto [5], [11]. The pull of the tissue by the cricothyroid muscle activation thins the vocal folds [9]. Therefore, only the ligamentous superficial layers of the vocal folds enter into vibration, possibly resulting in a negligible mucosal wave. Critical involvements of flow separation mobility in the oscillation mechanisms have been proposed [20]–[25]; however, it is not clear if the reported flow separation behavior is likely in the falsetto voice production with such a negligible vertical motion of the thin vocal folds.\nMore importantly, although the mucosal wave theory has been the cornerstone of nearly all subsequent theoretical developments of voice mechanics [e.g.], [ 26]–[30], it was developed under a quasi-steady flow assumption [8]. In particular, steady mass conservation and Bernoulli equations [1]–[5] were applied in those analytical studies without experimental verification of the decisive assumption under oscillating conditions. However, recent experimental and theoretical studies have demonstrated that the pressure distribution along the glottis essentially differs from that in a static condition in a range of high but realistic voice fundamental frequencies [23], [31]–[33]. In particular, our group analytically explained that the flow behavior in oscillating constriction (such as the pressure amplitude and phase difference between related variables) depends on the Strouhal number, i.e., a dimensionless number describing which effect is stronger, a flow induced by rapid wall motion (numerator) or a flow induced by the convective acceleration such as the speeding up of the airflow entering the converging glottis (denominator) [33]. The Strouhal number should not be negligible in the high vocal frequency range. In fact, Ishizaka and Matsudaira [1] described that their theory aimed at revealing self-excited oscillations in the chest register (i.e., a modal voice), possibly implying that the Bernoulli effect-based explanation might not be effective in the falsetto register.\nIt is also known that air column oscillation in the axially long or narrow vocal tract (including the pharynx and oral cavity) could play an additional role in producing higher pressure in the opening phase than in the closing phase [1]–[5], [34]. However, the threshold lung pressure due to the acoustic coupling between the vocal tract and glottis derived by Titze [4, Equation (50)] was not a function of the glottal width, suggesting that the acoustic coupling may only assist other primary mechanisms in reaching the oscillation threshold. Indeed, falsetto-like oscillations are produced even without a vocal tract in both self-excited physical vocal fold models and excised larynx models [35]–[39]. These observations suggest that the mucosal wave and vocal tract response may not perform a critical role in the onset mechanism of falsetto voice production [1].\nIn our previous theoretical work on fluid-structure interaction in the glottis oscillating at high speeds, we analytically derived the relationship between the time-varying glottal width and pressure perturbation from general unsteady flow equations [33]. The study demonstrated that a convective acceleration (i.e., a change in velocity over position) of a flow that was originally induced by rapid wall movement becomes comparable in magnitude to the Bernoulli effect within a physiological frequency range typical for a falsetto voice (e.g., >400 Hz). Because of this unsteady flow effect associated with the considerable Strouhal number, which was not taken into account in previous analytical studies on the phonation onset [e.g.], [ 1], [4,27], a phase difference (or time lag) can appear between the vocal fold motion and glottal pressure fluctuation. The time lag in the driving force may thus meet the requirements for self-excitation, i.e., continuous energy transfer from the airflow to vocal fold motion. Thus, we suggested that self-excitation could possibly occur from the inherent glottal flow property independent of the mucosal wave motion or inertial acoustic loading from the vocal tract or subglottis [40].\nIn our unsteady flow theory, we linearized the flow descriptions through perturbation analysis around the time-mean value; these small amplitude assumptions were also used in the previous analytical studies by Ishizaka and Matsudaira [1], [2] and Titze [4], [5]. While sustained modal voice in general involves large amplitude motion of the vocal folds with collision, the linearized small amplitude restriction indicates that the results are applied only to analyses of the phonation onset with no glottal closure. A falsetto voice often has a simple sinusoidal sound waveform with few higher harmonic waves, even in sustained conditions [9], indicating that the vocal fold oscillation in a falsetto voice occurs only near the surface tissue with small amplitudes. In addition, the fundamental frequency of a falsetto voice is sufficiently high to provoke the phase alteration caused by the unsteady flow effect [33]. Our flow theory thus seems to fit well with the analysis of the falsetto voice onset.\nIn the present study, we employed this flow theory to analytically derive the threshold conditions required for self-excitation of the vocal folds. The analysis demonstrated that an unsteady flow effect, or more specifically a convective acceleration of a flow induced by rapid wall movement, provides negative damping at the critical subglottal pressure or volume flow, inducing self-excited oscillation reminiscent of falsetto voice onset. Large amplitude behavior associated with established limit cycles, which involves nonlinear effects such as register transition and onset/offset hysteresis [27], [30], [41], [42], will not be discussed in this study. The tools of analysis for such large amplitude oscillations are primarily numerical [6], [7], [43], [44]. It is sometimes elusive to intuitively understand our ability to speak with a falsetto voice from such numerical (computational) results and the criteria for estimating the efficiency of voice production. Thus, it would be appropriate to devote a separate study to such numerical analyses.\nAnalysis\nModel geometry\nThe position along the inferior half of the glottis (see Fig. 1) is given by spatial coordinate x (see Fig. 3). Each cross section is assumed to be rectangular with a constant vocal fold length lg (normal to the plane of the paper). The vocal fold shape and its motion are assumed to be symmetrical with respect to the medial axis. The glottal half-width B(x,t) perpendicular to the x direction where t represents the time is assumed to be a constant value  at the upstream inlet (x = 0) and a time-varying value B(lc,t) (rewritten as Bc(t)) at the entrance of the narrowest constriction (x = lc). The glottis between x = 0 and lc is simply connected by a straight line:(1)The vocal fold constriction (from x = lc to lc+lv) is assumed to be a parallel path where lv is the vocal fold thickness. In fact, the linear geometry of the glottis presented here is not a requirement of the current study, rather, it is assumed to simplify analytical integration calculations and does not essentially affect the onset mechanism described below.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 3.  Vocal fold model.The inferior half of the glottis (dashed rectangular region in Fig. 1) is modeled.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0017503.g003\n\nFlow model\nIn our previous work, we developed a one dimensional unsteady flow theory that explicitly described the relationship between the time-varying glottal width and fluid pressure [33]. As this theory was applied to the present analysis, its derivation is briefly shown here with modifications to correspond with the present flow channel geometry. According to the accumulated knowledge on the internal flow in collapsible tubes [46]–[53], the mass and momentum conservation equations for an unsteady, viscous, and incompressible flow in a deformable tube are described by(2)(3)respectively, where U(x,t) is the velocity, P(x,t) is the pressure, ε is a factor related to flow separation and the vena contracta [3], [48], [53], ρa is the air density, and ν is the kinematic viscosity of air. Note that hereafter, for free variables x and t, the parentheses are often omitted for notational simplicity. Each variable is decomposed into a time-averaged component (lowercase letter with an overbar) and a time-varying perturbation component (lowercase letter):(4)(5)(6)The perturbations are small, and the terms of order higher than the quadratic are neglected. We assumed that pressure and velocity at x = 0 have constant values  and , respectively (see Fig. 3). The fixed boundary condition at the inlet is consistent with the previous analytical studies that assumed an ideal constant pressure source [4]. It is assumed that the fluid pressure at the center of the narrowest constriction, x = lc+lv/2, drives the vocal fold motion, as considered later in a vocal fold model with a single degree of freedom that does not exhibit mucosal waves. At the driving point,(7)(8)where Bc(t) = B(lc,t) = B(lc+lv/2,t) (see Fig. 3). Equation (2) is integrated along x from 0 to lc+lv/2, yielding a perturbation fluid velocity at the driving point [33]:(9)The perturbation glottal pressure that interacts with the perturbation of the vocal fold displacement is:(10)where a dot over a variable denotes its time derivative:  and δ are defined as the coefficients of each term. The first term  represents a force due to the convective acceleration (i.e., the effect of time-independent acceleration of a fluid with respect to space) of the wall motion-induced flow [33]. The second term δbc represents a convective inertial force, i.e., the Bernoulli effect. The former unsteady term could become comparable in magnitude to the latter steady term when the wall moves quick enough to produce a considerable wall motion-induced flow that is distinct from the steady flow determined by the static geometry of the channel. The considerable unsteady effect causes a phase lag between the pressure pc and the motion bc, which could result in meeting the requirements for self-excitation described above. The coupling of Equations (2) and (3) should actually have seven perturbation terms in general, but Equation (10) has only two terms because the remaining five terms, including the effect of air viscosity on the perturbation glottal pressure, are negligibly small in magnitude as confirmed by a thorough scale analysis performed in our previous work [33].\nVolume flow is defined by:(11)and divided depending on whether it is time dependent:(12)Temporal averages of Equations (2) and (3) satisfy:(13)(14)where Pt is the subglottal pressure (shown by the total pressure). Equation (14), obtained with simplification based on scale analysis [33], corresponds to Bernoulli's law for steady flow.\n\n\nVocal fold model\nThe equation of motion for the vocal fold is given by that of a mass-spring-damper oscillator in a lumped element representation (see Fig. 3):(15)where , , k, bi, , d, and  are the mass, damping coefficient, spring constant, initial half-width, density, depth, and damping ratio of the vocal fold, respectively. The depth d is not attributed to any one histological component such as the ligament, but represents the composite depth of effective structures; it is introduced to determine the effective mass m involved in vibration, which is a function of the density  as well as the geometric parameters, i.e., the vocal fold depth d, thickness lv, and length lg. In the steady state, Equation (15) becomes:(16)From Equations (7), (8), (10), and (15), we obtain the following perturbation equation:(17)The coefficients of the second and third terms on the left side represent effective damping and effective stiffness, respectively.\n\n\nThreshold pressure and volume flow for oscillatory divergence due to negative damping\nThe system of Equations (13), (14), and (16) that describes steady states has, in general, three analytical solutions (one trivial solution for the hydrostatic condition and two non-trivial solutions with non-zero flow velocities). However, in the actual vocal fold mechanics because flow accelerates significantly in the constricted glottis, the following approximations are applicable [4]:(18)(19)Here,  is assumed to be zero to exclude acoustic coupling with the vocal tract. With these approximations, the steady state has the following single solution with real numbers:(20)(21)(22)(23)When the coefficient of the second term of Equation (17) is negative (i.e., negative damping), a dynamic instability or flutter [49], [54] occurs in which a perturbation gradually develops to induce oscillatory divergence (see Fig. 4A). The threshold subglottal pressure  and volume flow  for flutter are explicitly described by:(24)(25)respectively, where the constriction length l is defined as(26)The critical subglottal pressure described by Equation (24) is interpreted as the minimum lung pressure required for vocal fold oscillation onset. Such a critical lung pressure is in general called the phonation threshold pressure (PTP) and is potentially useful in diagnosis to noninvasively evaluate vocal fold stiffness and quantify the ease of phonation [4], [55]. Equation (25) denotes the minimum volume flow necessary for voice onset, which has recently been called the phonation threshold volume flow (PTF) [26], [56], [57]. As mentioned in Section 2.2, we estimated in a previous work that the viscous resistance in the glottis has a negligibly small magnitude compared to the convective and unsteady flow effects [33]. This scale analysis yields Equation (14) or the Bernoulli's equation, implying that the fluid energy (i.e., the sum of the pressure and kinetic energies) is conserved. PTP (Pf) and PTF (Qf) are obtained from the same condition (i.e., the second term of Equation (17) is zero), that is, they are merely one expression of the same critical condition required for the oscillatory divergence. Hence, in the present modeling, the input of fluid energy to the vocal fold system to achieve PTP is the same as that for PTF.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 4.  Schema of two types of instability.Flutter or oscillatory divergence (A). This dynamic instability results in the self-excitation of the vocal folds. Divergence or static instability (B).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0017503.g004\n\nUnidirectional divergence due to negative stiffness\nWhen the coefficient of the third term of Equation (17), representing the intrinsic stiffness versus the Bernoulli effect, is negative (i.e., negative stiffness), a static instability or divergence [54] occurs upon imposition of a perturbation to the system (see Fig. 4B) [58]. The threshold subglottal pressure and volume flow for the divergence are described by:(27)(28)respectively. The present study employed a simple single degree of freedom model for the vocal folds (see Fig. 3) to exclude the mucosal wave motion. In addition, we linearized the behavior around the time-mean value. Within this current modeling, the static instability indicated that a unidirectional deformation occurred around the slightly abducted (spread apart) vocal folds, and the vocal folds were either blown open or closed by the airflow [58]. Note that if a vocal fold model with a degree of freedom more than two is employed together with proper mechanical properties [3], limit cycles (different from being kept opened or closed) after the static instability could be established in a collision-dependent manner explained by the myoelastic-aerodynamic theory (see Fig. 2A). To determine whether the limit cycles occur after the static instability (as already performed by Ishizaka and Flanagan [3]), incorporation of the following is required: (1) an additional degree of freedom to the vocal fold model, (2) another mechanical property related to the coupling between the upper and lower masses (or the ease of mucosal wave propagation), and (3) the effect of glottal closure or collision. Such additional modeling is beyond the scope of the present study that aims at introducing a framework of the basic principles to help in understanding the mechanics of falsetto voice onset. In addition, the limit cycles with collision after static instability are in general regarded as the source of modal voice [9], [58]. Therefore, henceforth we focus on only negative damping-induced flutter, i.e., Pf (PTP) and Qf (PTF), but not on static instability Pd and Qd. In fact, Ishizaka and Matsudaira [1] and Titze [4] also developed their theories on the basis of negative damping-induced oscillatory divergence.\n\n\nThe effect of vocal fundamental frequency on PTP and PTF\nPTP and PTF expressed by Equations (24) and (25), respectively, contain the spring constant k, representing the intrinsic stiffness of the vocal folds, which may be difficult to measure at various conditions [4], [28]. In terms of practical use, therefore, the fundamental frequency of a voice F0 may be suitable as an alternative dependent variable instead of k. Thus, another form of PTP and PTF as a function of F0 is derived below. At the critical condition that allows the onset of flutter, the coefficient of the second term of Equation (17) becomes zero. The frequency at that instant is defined as:(29)From Equations (10) and (21), the Bernoulli effect  at the oscillatory divergence onset (i.e., Pt = Pf) is:(30)From Equations (29) and (30),(31)Substitution of Equation (31) into Equations (24) and (25) yields alternative forms of PTP and PTF that contain F0 as an explicit factor:(32)(33)where(34)From Equations (10), (17), (21), (22), and (26), the newly introduced dimensionless number FL, associated with the ease of flutter [49], [54] in a viscoelastic flow channel or falsetto voice onset, is interpreted as:(35)Thus, FL quantifies the relative importance of the distinct effects. Note that as long as flutter occurs more readily than the unidirectional divergence given by Equations (27) and (28), Pf<Pd, and hence, FL>1. Thus, both Pf and Qf have positive values by definition.\n\n\nQuantitative assessment\nTo evaluate the quantitative validity of the derived PTP (Pf, Equation (24)) and PTF (Qf, Equation (25)), we applied the following representative values, which are within the physiological range used in the previous phonation modeling [2], [3], [28], [59]–[61]:  = 0.35 mm,  = 35 N/m,  = 10 mm,  = 15 mm,  = 1.5 mm,  = 1,  = 1.1 kg/m3,  = 1.02×103 kg/m3, and  = 0.235. PTP and PTF, shown as functions of the initial glottal half-width bi, were estimated as ~0.1–1 kPa and ~10–300 cm3/s, respectively (see Figs. 5 and 6). They were comparable in magnitude as per the reported measurement data [26], [42], [55]–[57], [62]–[64]. Note that on the basis of his measurements, van den Berg [9] mentioned that 9 to 10 mL of air were sufficient for the production of sound for 0.5 s (i.e., roughly equal to 20 cm3/s).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 5.

At a small bi of <0.35 mm, flutter requires a lower upstream pressure or volume flow as compared with that of the static instability, indicating that the former occurs more readily. On the other hand, the static instability occurs more readily than the flutter at a high bi.\nFigures 7 and 8 depict the effect of vocal fold thickness lv on PTP and PTF, respectively, at a constant bi of 0.35 mm. As the thickness is reduced, it becomes more difficult to initiate flutter, but it is more likely to occur than static instability at thin vocal folds. This tendency is consistent with the morphological observation that in the falsetto voice, the vocal fold tissue margins are rather thin and pointed due to the tension exerted by the contraction of the cricothyroid muscle [9], [59].\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 7.

As described in the introduction and in the literature [9], [60], activation of the cricothyroid muscle at a high fundamental frequency reduces the vocal fold depth. Thus, the depth d can correspond to the effective tissue depth of vibration [60]. In general, muscular tissues have a larger hysteresis loss between loading and unloading than ligamentous tissues [65], [66]. Therefore, the decrease in the depth that may alter the dominant vibrating part from the muscular region to the ligamentous one [4], [9] would be followed by a reduction in the damping ratio of related tissues. Since the two parameters d and  do not affect the magnitude of Pd (Equation (27)), Pf falls below Pd as the expected cricothyroid muscle activation proceeds. Thus, the quantitative evaluation suggests that flutter occurs more readily than static instability at a high fundamental frequency as in the falsetto voice (see Fig. 9).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 9.

In these figures, the initial glottal half-width bi is fixed at less than 0.35 mm, assuring that flutter occurs (see Figs. 5 and 6). Pf is proportional to the square of F0 as explicitly shown in Equation (32), whereas Qf is proportional to the first power of F0 as shown in Equation (33). This quantitative evaluation demonstrates that PTP and PTF have realistic values within the frequency range typical for a falsetto voice (i.e., >400 Hz) [26], [55].\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 10.

The effect of vocal fundamental frequency F0 on Qf.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0017503.g011\nDiscussionThus far, numerical (computational) simulations of falsetto-like voice production have been performed using unsteady flow equations, essentially the same as those used in the present study [6], [7], [43]–[45]. Such numerical analyses are useful in investigating the entire process of the voice production over a wide range where nonlinear effects may play essential roles. In contrast, the present study provided the first complete analytical description dealing with the mechanism of self-excitation at high fundamental frequencies, reminiscent of falsetto voice onset. The explicit descriptions of the phonation onset (Pf and Qf; Equations (24) and (25) or (32) and (33), respectively) may be useful for capturing the mutual relationships among basic parameters at a glance and for understanding the essential mechanism of the complex fluid-structure interaction phenomenon. The threshold conditions were quantitatively reasonable in view of the reported measurement data [9], [26], [42], [55]–[57], [62]–[64] (see Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11). The mutual relationships among parameters, such as the effect of vocal fold stiffness on the onset upstream pressure, make intuitive sense and are consistent with the tendencies obtained in previous numerical analyses [6], [7], [43]. The present results were obtained from a single degree of freedom system with a small amplitude approximation. Therefore, the findings derived analytically from general physical governing equations are specifically applicable to a small amplitude or a falsetto voice rather than a modal voice that has large amplitude and non-uniform motion of the vocal folds.\nThe current study mathematically revealed that the vocal folds could be self-excited independent of a mucosal wave or glottal closure if general unsteady flow equations are employed. Oscillatory divergence or flutter (see Fig. 4A) is thus triggered through a different mechanism than that previously considered. In particular, when the vocal fold wall moves so quickly that the effect of the time-varying motion achieves a significant magnitude, a slower fluid velocity than that estimated based on a steady flow appears in the glottis during the opening vocal fold movement (see Figs. 12A and 12B). This deceleration occurs because individual air particles (but not liquid particles as in Washio et al. [67]) adjacent to the wall must follow the quick movement so as to not break the interface between the solid wall and the fluid. This model is essentially different from that of the Bernoulli effect in which the absolute value of the glottal width determines the fluid velocity (see Fig. 12B). Likewise, in the closing phase, a faster fluid velocity than that estimated based on a steady flow is present. In consequence, a higher driving pressure is applied to the vocal folds during the opening movement (see Fig. 13), inducing the self-excited oscillation, because the vocal folds can receive positive energy from the flow as the oscillation proceeds.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 12.  The effect of rapid wall movement on internal flow.Convective acceleration (or the Bernoulli effect) is the time-independent acceleration of a fluid with respect to space (A). The size of the letter P and the length of the arrows indicate the magnitude of glottal pressure and that of the fluid velocity in a converging duct, respectively. Although the flow may be steady (time-independent), the fluid accelerates as it moves down the converging duct; thus, there is an acceleration happening over position, referred to as convective acceleration or the Bernoulli effect. Relationship between the glottal width and velocity (B). At a steady state (i), the perturbations of variables bc, uc, and pc are all zero. If a perturbation bc with a positive value is slowly given to the steady state (ii), such enlargement of the constriction weakens the convective acceleration and hence decreases the instantaneous velocity Uc with the appearance of a negative perturbation velocity uc and a consequent positive perturbation pressure pc. Instead, let us consider a case in which a perturbation bc with a positive value is very quickly given to the steady state (iii). The wall moves so fast that not only the bc-induced negative perturbation velocity uc1 (identical to uc in (ii)) but also an additional negative velocity component uc2 proportional in magnitude to the time derivative of the wall motion dbc/dt appears. Here, uc1 and uc2 correspond to the second and first terms on the right side of Equation (9), respectively. The additional velocity component due to the rapid wall movement also experiences convective acceleration; therefore, a perturbation pressure higher in magnitude than (ii) is obtained at (iii), as graphically shown by pc with a big size. Likewise, a fast narrowing of the wall (i.e., negative bc) yields a negative perturbation pressure pc whose absolute value is greater than that estimated from the apparent width (figure not shown). Previous quantitative evaluation [33] suggested that the magnitude of uc2-originated perturbation pressure (i.e., the first term on the right side of Equation (10)) reaches approximately 50% of the uc1-originated one (the second term on the right side of Equation (10)) at 500 Hz; thus, playing a significant role for driving pressure in falsetto voice onset.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0017503.g012\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 13.  Mechanism of falsetto voice onset.Pressure and width fluctuate with the same phase at a quasi-steady state (A). In contrast, due to the convective acceleration of the rapid wall motion-induced flow shown in (iii) of Figure 12B, a phase difference appears between the variables (B) because the magnitude of pc is partly determined by how fast the wall moves (Equation (10)). Previous work [33] showed that the phase difference is practically dependent only on the Strouhal number, but note that the perturbation pressures always have (on average) larger values during the opening phase than during the closing phase. This asymmetry in pressure magnitude over one cycle (C) can lead to self-excitation of the vocal folds only if the threshold condition Pf or Qf is satisfied.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0017503.g013The fluid force that induces the static instability (shown by the second term in the middle of Equation (10)) comes from the Bernoulli effect. This term is proportional to the dynamic pressure or the square of the glottal velocity . In contrast, the fluid force that induces flutter is caused by the convective acceleration of a fluid velocity induced by rapid motion of the vocal fold tissue (see Fig. 12). The tissue motion-induced velocity itself is independent of the time-mean fluid velocity  as explicitly described in the first term on the right side of Equation (9). Therefore, the flutter-related force (shown by the first term in the middle of Equation (10)) varies with the first (but not the second) power of , representing the effect of convection. Both the separate fluid forces are inversely proportional to  (or bi of Equation (22)) as shown in Equation (10), because the ratio of the displacement perturbation bc to the initial width bi (rather than bc itself) influences the pressure perturbation pc. Equations (20) and (21) imply that the critical subglottal pressures that induce instability should be proportional to the square of the glottal velocity . As a result, PTP (i.e., Pf) is proportional to the square of bi whereas the critical pressure for the static instability (Pd) is proportional to the first power of bi. Thus, the diverse dependencies on bi yield flutter- and unidirectional divergence-dominant regions (see Fig. 5). Equations (20) and (23) imply that PTF is proportional to bi as well as to the square root of PTP, indicating that PTF (Qf) is proportional to the square of bi, whereas the critical volume flow for unidirectional divergence (Qd) is proportional to the two-thirds power of bi (see Fig. 6).\nAlthough the relationships between F0 and PTP or PTF are explicitly expressed in Equations (32) and (33) and graphically shown in Figures 10 and 11, we should note that the vocal fold-related parameters that constitute Pf and Qf are in fact interdependent on each other. Laryngeal muscle activation results in diverse changes in vocal fold geometry and mechanical properties; thus, a shift in one parameter alters multiple interdependent parameters simultaneously. The parameters used in the present modeling are independent of each other in order to avoid expedient assumptions and consequent loss of generality. Establishing a plausible assumption that adequately specifies the relationship between the parameters will be needed for practical cases and will be a subject of future investigations. Note that the current explanation for the falsetto voice onset mechanism does not exclude the effect of acoustic coupling with the axially long vocal tract and subglottis [3]–[5], [34], [40]. The acoustic effect as well as the unsteady flow behavior highlighted here may cooperatively contribute to the self-excitation in actual phonation. However, it is notable that human PTP–F0 relationships reported by Solomon et al. [63] and Titze [62], [68], which were examined in high frequency ranges, indicate that some subjects appear to have a concave PTP–F0 curve at a high frequency range, thereby being consistent with the current result (see Fig. 10).\nIn summary, we analytically derived biomechanical conditions required for falsetto voice onset from general unsteady flow equations. In this model, the self-excitation of the vocal folds in a falsetto voice arises through inherent flow properties in a rapidly oscillating wall, a process that is distinct from the mucosal wave-based explanation submitted previously and based on a quasi-steady flow assumption. This model of the falsetto voice onset provides explicit relationships among the vocal fold geometry, biomechanical parameters, and fundamental frequency.\nFigure S1.
