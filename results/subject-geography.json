                "\n        The Δ32 mutation at the CCR5 locus is a well-studied example of natural selection acting in humans. The mutation is found principally in Europe and western Asia, with higher frequencies generally in the north. Homozygous carriers of the Δ32 mutation are resistant to HIV-1 infection because the mutation prevents functional expression of the CCR5 chemokine receptor normally used by HIV-1 to enter CD4+ T cells. HIV has emerged only recently, but population genetic data strongly suggest Δ32 has been under intense selection for much of its evolutionary history. To understand how selection and dispersal have interacted during the history of the Δ32 allele, we implemented a spatially explicit model of the spread of Δ32. The model includes the effects of sampling, which we show can give rise to local peaks in observed allele frequencies. In addition, we show that with modest gradients in selection intensity, the origin of the Δ32 allele may be relatively far from the current areas of highest allele frequency. The geographic distribution of the Δ32 allele is consistent with previous reports of a strong selective advantage (>10%) for Δ32 carriers and of dispersal over relatively long distances (>100 km/generation). When selection is assumed to be uniform across Europe and western Asia, we find support for a northern European origin and long-range dispersal consistent with the Viking-mediated dispersal of Δ32 proposed by G. Lucotte and G. Mercier. However, when we allow for gradients in selection intensity, we estimate the origin to be outside of northern Europe and selection intensities to be strongest in the northwest. Our results describe the evolutionary history of the Δ32 allele and establish a general methodology for studying the geographic distribution of selected alleles.\n      \n        A spatially explicit model of the Δ32 mutation, which confers resistance to HIV-1 infection, reveals its spread across Europe and provides a general method for tracking the geographic spread of selected alleles.\n      "

            "fulltext": "IntroductionThe geographic spread of advantageous alleles is fundamental to evolutionary processes, including the geographic distribution of adaptive traits, the cohesiveness of species, and the spatial dynamics of coevolution between pathogens and their hosts. Various theoretical models describe the dynamics of how advantageous alleles spread within a population, but few well-studied examples exist, particularly in humans, of how advantageous alleles spread geographically.\nThe CCR5 Δ32 mutation is a good example of an advantageous allele with a well-characterized geographic distribution. The Δ32 mutation currently plays an important role in HIV resistance because heterozygous carriers have reduced susceptibility to infection and delayed onset of AIDS, while homozygous carriers are resistant to HIV infection [1]. The mutation is found principally in Europe and western Asia, where average frequencies are approximately 10%, although the frequency varies within this geographic area. HIV only recently emerged as a human pathogen, so researchers were surprised when various sources of evidence showed strong selection in favor of Δ32 throughout its history. The age of the Δ32 allele has been estimated to be between 700 and 3,500 y based on linkage disequilibrium data [2,3], and recent ancient DNA evidence suggests the allele is at least 2,900 y old [4]. If Δ32 were neutral, population genetics theory predicts it would have to be much older given its frequency. The alternative explanation is that the Δ32 mutation occurred recently and then increased rapidly in frequency because of a strong selective advantage [2,5]. Quantitative studies have concluded that heterozygous carriers of Δ32 in the past had a fitness advantage of at least 5% and possibly as high as 35% [2,3]. Bubonic plague was initially proposed as the selective agent [2], but subsequent analysis suggested that a disease like smallpox is a more plausible candidate ([6–8], with reviews in [9–11]).\nTo understand the origin and spread of Δ32, we modeled the effects of selection and dispersal on the allele. The Δ32 mutation is found only in European, West Asian, and North African populations. The allele frequency exhibits a north–south cline with frequencies ranging from 16% in northern Europe to 6% in Italy and 4% in Greece (Figure 1; [2,5,12–17]). The broadest area of high frequency is located in northeastern Europe, particularly the Baltic region, as represented by samples from Sweden, Finland, Belarus, Estonia, and Lithuania. There are additional peaks of frequency in samples from the northern coast of France, the Russian cities of Moscow and Ryazan, and portions of the Volga–Ural region of Russia. Ashkenazi Jews have high frequencies of Δ32, but this is likely due to founder effects unique to their history rather than the general process of dispersal that spread the allele in other populations [18].\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.  Shaded Contour Map of Δ32 Allele Frequency DataThe sampling locations are marked by black points. The interpolation is masked in regions where data are unavailable.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0030339.g001Previous discussion of the geographic distribution of Δ32 has focused on the north–south cline in frequency. Lucotte and Mercier [12] suggested that the cline and other features of the geographic distribution imply a Viking origin. In particular they proposed that the allele was present in Scandinavia before 1,000 to 1,200 y ago and then was carried by Vikings northward to Iceland, eastward to Russia, and southward to central and southern Europe. The age and geographic distribution of the allele are consistent with the qualitative predictions of the Viking hypothesis [12,17], but there has been no quantitative analysis of the Viking hypothesis or alternative hypotheses.\nOne alternative is that a northern origin coupled with typical levels of dispersal in Europe is adequate to explain the geographic distribution of Δ32. Under this hypothesis, rare long-distance dispersal events, such as Viking dispersal, play a minor role in the spread of the advantageous allele. Another alternative is that the allele may have arisen in central Europe and increased to a higher frequency in the north because of a geographical gradient in selection intensity [19]. There are two plausible biological causes for a gradient in selection. First, the selective advantage of Δ32 may have been larger in the north. This hypothesis stems from anecdotal evidence that indicates smallpox epidemics were more intense in northern Europe [20]. A second mechanism is that a selective cost associated with the Δ32 allele may have been stronger in the south, and thus the overall selection intensity in favor of Δ32 may have been weaker in the south and stronger in the north. While there is little direct evidence that Δ32 carriers are more susceptible to general infection [10,11], the plausibility of a selective cost of Δ32 is supported by evidence that chemokines play an important role in inflammatory responses to infection [21,22] and by studies with mice that show that CCR5 knockouts have poor immune responses to various pathogenic infections [23–25]. These results suggest some pathogens may have an advantage infecting Δ32 carriers because the immune response is impaired by the absence of functional CCR5 chemokine receptors. If such pathogens tended to be more prevalent in the temperate climates of southern Europe, then a selection gradient would arise. It is even plausible that Δ32 could be disadvantageous in certain areas where the protective effect is outweighed by the disadvantage of a weakened immune response. In a model with selection gradients, Viking dispersal may still contribute to the spread of the allele, but the geographic origin of the allele and the influence of spatially variable selection differ from that in the Viking hypothesis.\nA further question regarding the geographic spread of Δ32 is whether the historical selective agent acted only in Europe and western Asia or on a larger geographic scale. In the former case, the restriction of Δ32 to Europe and western Asia is explained by spatially varying selection, and in the latter, by insufficient time for the allele to have dispersed farther.\nHere we fit a simple population genetic model to the geographic distribution of Δ32 in order to infer features of the processes of dispersal and selection that shaped the historical spread of the allele. In particular we conclude that given current estimates of the age of the Δ32 allele, the allele must have spread rapidly via long-range dispersal and intense selection to attain its current range. We find the Δ32 allele is likely restricted geographically because of limited time to disperse rather than local selection pressures. In addition, we show that the data are consistent with origins of the mutation outside of northern Europe and modest gradients in selection.\nResultsTo examine the geographic distribution of Δ32, we adapted Fisher's deterministic “wave of advance” [26] model of selection and dispersal to a geographically explicit representation of Europe and western Asia. The wave-of-advance model is a continuous-time, continuous-space, partial-differential-equation (PDE) model that describes the change in allele frequency at any point in the range in terms of the effects of dispersal and selection. The model treats dispersal as a diffusion process, which implicitly assumes the effects of dispersal can be approximated by considering only the mean and variance of the dispersal distribution. Furthermore, dispersal is assumed to be homogeneous across the range and isotropic (i.e., the mean of the dispersal distribution is zero). In the simplest form of the model, the allele under selection is additive in effect and selection intensity is assumed to be homogeneous across the range. We then extended the model to allow for both east–west and north–south gradients in selection intensity. The parameters of the model are the initial population density (D), the initial position of the mutation in terms of latitude and longitude (x0 and y0, respectively), and the ratio (R) of the variance in the parent–offspring dispersal distance distribution (σ2) to the additive selection coefficient s. When a gradient in selection intensity was incorporated, sc was the selection coefficient in the center of the gradient and GNS and GEW were the percent changes in the selection coefficient per kilometer of north–south and east–west distance, respectively.\nTo apply the model to allele frequency data sampled from different locations, we combined the spatially explicit PDE model with a binomial sampling scheme (see Materials and Methods). With this approach the data are viewed as being a set of binomial samples from an underlying, unobserved allele frequency surface that is generated by the PDE model. One feature of this model is that while the underlying allele frequency surface produced by the PDE model may be unimodal and smooth, the resulting data are expected to be noisy and multimodal owing to the binomial sampling step. The multimodal nature of data expected under the model approximates that found in the dataset of Δ32 allele frequencies we collated from 71 locations across Europe, northern Africa, and Asia (Figure 1; data described in Materials and Methods). Indeed when simulations are used to generate allele frequency data with identical sampling locations and sample sizes as in the collated dataset, multiple peaks are often found that are similar to those observed in real data (Figure 2). This result demonstrates that specific regions of high frequency are not necessarily generated by unusual local conditions or specific migration events, but can arise because of sampling in models with homogeneous dispersal.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 2.

The results show that underlying smooth, unimodal allele frequency surfaces can give rise to irregular, multimodal observed allele frequency surfaces.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0030339.g002To estimate the parameters of the model, we derived a likelihood function based on binomial sampling from the deterministic allele frequency surface. Estimating parameters via maximum likelihood requires an optimization step, and here we use a simple grid search. We found in applications to simulated data that the likelihood method with a grid search is able to estimate parameters with reasonable accuracy (Table 1).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 1.  The Effect of the Dispersal Distribution on the Estimates of R and σdoi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0030339.t001The result of the maximum likelihood estimation is that values of R = σ2/s on the order of 105 and 106 km2 have the highest likelihood. The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of R depends on whether selection gradients are allowed. When GNS = GEW = 0, the estimate of R is 2.77 × 105 km2 with the profile likelihood falling off nearly symmetrically for higher and lower values (Figure 3). When GNS and GEW are treated as free parameters, the MLE of R is 1.03 × 106 km2 with a steep drop in likelihood for values less than 105 and a gradual decline for values greater than 106 (Figure 3). Values of R on the order of 104 km2 or smaller result in an expected geographic distribution of Δ32 that is too restricted to fit the data, and values of R on the order of 107 result in a distribution that is far too broad. Figure 4 demonstrates the values of σ and s implied by these estimates. The value of σ is consistently larger than 100 km for s ≥ 0.05. These values of σ are larger than estimates based on studies of historical and modern dispersal, which indicate that σ ranges from 1 to 75 km in European populations [27]. Conversely, values of σ < 75 km, imply values of s ≤ 0.02, which are lower than estimates of s ≈ 0.05–0.35 obtained in previous studies based on Δ32 frequency and linkage disequilibrium data [2,3].\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 3.

The MLE of R in this case is 2.77 × 105 with a log-likelihood of −263.0. The black line shows the profile likelihood when selection gradients are incorporated into the model (GNS and GEW are free parameters). The corresponding MLE of R is 1.03 × 106 with a log likelihood of −247.7.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0030339.g003\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 4.  The Dispersal Parameter σ as a Function of the Selection Intensity sThe curves are drawn for the two MLEs of R and labeled accordingly. 1Based on estimates in [2] and [3]. 2From Table 1 of [27].\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0030339.g004The time required in the model to reach a frequency of 16% for a fixed value of s is indicative of the age of the Δ32 allele. Using this information we find that strong selection (s ≥ 0.1) is necessary to reconcile the spatially explicit model of Δ32 with estimates of the allele age. The linkage disequilibrium data of Stephens et al. [2] and Libert et al. [5] suggest the age of the Δ32 allele falls in the range of 700–3,500 y, and recent ancient DNA data suggest the allele arose at least 2,900 y ago[4]. Assuming s = 0.1, we found across the range of origins we investigated that 130–156 generations (3,250–3,900 y) are required to reach current frequencies, which is consistent with the upper range of allele age estimates from linkage disequilibrium data and the ancient DNA data. To generate younger allele ages would require selection coefficients larger than 0.1. For weaker selection coefficients, the ages must be much larger. As an example, 650–780 generations (16,250–19,500 y) are required to reach current frequencies assuming s = 0.02.\nWe next investigated whether the data reject the hypothesis of uniform selection gradients. We used a likelihood ratio test that compares the maximum likelihood achieved when GNS and GEW are both restricted to zero to the maximum likelihood obtained when GNS and GEW are estimated from the data. As shown in Figure 3, when GNS and GEW are free parameters, the maximum log-likelihood is approximately −248. With GNS and GEW fixed to zero, we find the maximum likelihood at −263. As a result, the likelihood ratio statistic is strongly significant (likelihood ratio statistic = 30, df = 2, p < 10−5), such that we can reject the null hypothesis of uniform selection.\nIn the model with selection gradients, selection was inferred to be stronger in the north and in the west, with the north–south selection gradient being steeper than the east–west selection gradient. In particular, the estimates of GNS and GEW were GNS = 1.3 × 10−4 and GEW = −0.25 × 10−4. The profile likelihood surface for GEW and GNS shows a peak such that the likelihood drops off steeply from the maximum in both directions along the GEW axis while only declining gradually from the maximum in the GNS axis (Figure 5). The magnitude of the gradients is not extreme. For instance, the gradient of GNS = 1.3 × 10−4 km−1 implies a selection intensity at the latitude of Oslo that is a 21% increase on the selection intensity at the latitude of Milan (e.g., s = 0.23 in Oslo versus s = 0.19 in Milan). Similarly, GEW = −0.25 × 10−4 km−1 generates a selection intensity in Copenhagen that is 5% greater than in Moscow (e.g., s = 0.22 in Copenhagen and s = 0.21 in Moscow).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 5.

The dark contour at −250 marks the −2 log-likelihood support region for the estimates of GNS and GEW.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0030339.g005Regarding the geographic origin of Δ32, we found that if selection is constrained to be spatially uniform, the origin is localized to a region east of the Baltic (Figure 6A; parameter set NE in Table 2). Moreover, the likelihood surface drops off dramatically outside of this region. If gradients in selection are incorporated, the origins with the highest likelihood are in southern Europe, with the maximum likelihood origin west of the Caspian (Figure 6B; parameter set C in Table 2). An origin in Spain (parameter set SW in Table 2) and an origin east of the Caspian (parameter set SE in Table 2) are within two log-likelihood units of the maximum. All three origins are coupled with an inference of a south-to-north and east-to-west increase in selection intensity. Origins in northern Europe have low likelihood, although the likelihood surface is fairly flat so that origins with a latitude as high as 58° are within six log-likelihood units of the maximum.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 6.

Detailed Results for Parameter Sets with High Likelihoodsdoi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0030339.t002The underlying allele frequency surface generated by the MLE parameters is a qualitative indicator of the goodness of fit of the model (see Figure 2A). The frequency surface is broadly consistent with the observed allele frequency distribution (see Figure 1), although the estimated underlying distribution shows allele frequencies to be higher than observed in the northernmost part of Scandinavia and in parts of southern Europe. In addition, the estimated surface shows a region in the northeast of Russia where no data points exist and Δ32 is predicted to be present in frequencies of 8%–10%. Simulated data from the MLE allele frequency surface, with sample sizes and locations that are identical to those in the original dataset, have features such as multiple peaks that are present in the original data (for two examples of simulated data see Figure 2B and 2C). When we quantitatively tested the goodness of fit using a G-test, we rejected the null hypothesis that the data are derived from the model (G = 205.6, df = 66, p < 10−5). We also found that the data are overdispersed relative to the variance expected under a binomial distribution. The overdispersion parameter ϕ (see Materials and Methods) was estimated to be 3.1 where a value of one is expected under the model.\nFinally, to better understand the history of Δ32, we considered an extension of the model that included the dispersal of the allele to Iceland. Iceland was colonized principally from Scandinavia at approximately 900 CE [28] and present-day Iceland samples show a high frequency of Δ32 [13]. To model the frequency of Δ32 in Iceland, we used a single-population selection model for Iceland with initial conditions based on the mainland PDE model (see Materials and Methods). We used this simple model to calculate an expected frequency of Δ32 in Iceland at the present day. Data from present-day Iceland show a frequency of 14.7% in a sample of 204 chromosomes [13]. Hypothetical origins outside of northern Europe result in underestimates of the frequency in Iceland, and a northern origin results in a slight overestimate (for examples, see Table 2). To integrate the Iceland results into the analysis of the mainland frequency data, we used the fact that the observation in Iceland is an independent data point and added the log-likelihood of the Iceland data to that obtained from the mainland allele frequency data. An origin in Spain (parameter set SW in Table 2) is found to be the MLE with a log-likelihood of −261.0. We also found that an origin at 53°N 13°E in northern Germany (parameter set G in Table 2) has a log-likelihood of −262.4 and is the only other origin within two log-likelihood units of parameter set SW. Thus, including historical information about Iceland shifts the estimated origin to western Europe, with likely origins in Spain or northern Germany.\nDiscussionWe can draw several conclusions from our analysis of the geographic distribution of the Δ32 allele. First, the results suggest that strong selection (s ≥ 0.10) and long-distance dispersal of humans (σ > 100 km) are necessary to explain the current geographic distribution of the Δ32 allele. Values of σ > 100 km are larger than the estimates of 1–75 km found in various studies using historical records for Europeans [27]. If, however, the Δ32 allele is older and less advantageous than previously estimated [3,4,6], which has been suggested recently by [29], then our analysis of the geographic distribution becomes more consistent with previously published estimates of dispersal distances in European populations. Because our results depend on the ratio R = σ2/s, a smaller s implies estimates of σ that are closer to those based on historical records (see Figure 4), although still somewhat larger. For example, for our MLE of R = 1.03 × 106, a value of s = 0.0075 corresponds to σ = 88 km. One explanation for the discrepancy between genetic and historical estimates of dispersal distance is that the estimates based on historical records may be too low because they do not reflect longer-distance dispersal events such as those associated with trade routes or population movements. Our larger estimate of σ may reflect such long-distance dispersal events.\nSecond, we conclude that if selection is spatially uniform, Δ32 arose by mutation in northeast Europe as suggested by Libert et al. [5]. This hypothesis is parsimonious because it does not require gradients in selection intensity. If selection is not spatially uniform, we find the geographic origin could be far from locations where Δ32 is currently in high frequency. We reach this conclusion because, in our model, dispersal dominates initially and spreads the new allele over a large geographic area before selection can increase the allele frequency locally. When we allow for selection gradients and take account of the data from Iceland, we conclude that Δ32 most likely originated either in Spain or northern Germany. The gradients in selection intensity needed are not extreme and are on the order of only a 20% relative difference between southern and northern Europe and a 5% relative difference between eastern and western Europe. Although allowing for selection gradients is less parsimonious, the model with selection gradients had a significantly higher likelihood than the model with uniform selection. The north–south gradient detected here is consistent with anecdotal evidence that smallpox was more prevalent in the north [20].\nThird, our results show that the geographically restricted distribution of Δ32 is a result of Δ32 not having had time to disperse more widely, rather than resulting from a geographic restriction of selection favoring it. Given more time and no change in selection affecting Δ32, the allele would have spread over a wider area.\nOur large estimates of dispersal are consistent with the Viking hypothesis of Lucotte and Mercier [12]. Moreover, when selection is assumed to be spatially uniform, the maximum likelihood origin is in southern Finland. However, incorporating gradients in selection provided significantly better fits to the data, and in models with gradients, origins in Scandinavia did not have high likelihoods. Thus, our likelihood-based analysis provides some support for the Viking hypothesis in that we detect a strong signature of long-range dispersal events, but it also raises the possibility that the allele arose outside of Scandinavia and spread into the region via dispersers from the south.\nOur analysis makes a number of simplifying assumptions. Our model does not incorporate genetic drift. To examine the effect of ignoring drift, we simulated a stepping stone model with local deme sizes of Ne = 2,500 and a selection coefficient of s = 0.05. We found that with drift, the allele frequency surface becomes somewhat more jagged than without drift, but the underlying shapes are still the same (results not shown). Concluding that drift is negligible based on the simulation results is conservative as the selection coefficient of Δ32 is most likely at least 0.05 [2,3] and the effective population size of a deme (where 1° latitude by 1° longitude may be considered a deme) would be greater than 2,500 even assuming 2000 BCE population densities (2.5 km−2; [30]) and Ne as one-quarter of the census population size. Additional support for the idea that drift is unimportant for the large-scale patterns in this type of model comes from the analytical results of Kot et al. [31] for a similar model of branching random walks. They show that the average rate of expansion in a stochastic model is similar to that in a deterministic model.\nAnother assumption of our approach is that the allele under selection has an additive effect. We tested the robustness of our results to deviations from additivity by generating allele frequency surfaces in which the fitness advantage of Δ32 heterozygotes is kept constant and a range of fitness advantages of the Δ32/Δ32 genotype was assumed. We found that varying the degree of dominance had little effect on the geographic distribution of Δ32 (results not shown). The negligible importance of the fitness advantage of Δ32 homozygotes arises because the proportion of Δ32 homozygotes is sufficiently small throughout the history of Δ32 that the assumption regarding the fitness of the homozygote only has a minor effect.\nOur use of diffusion equations assumes that only the mean and variance of the dispersal distribution are needed to model the effects of dispersal and that higher central moments such as kurtosis are negligible. Studies of Fisher's wave of advance in the ecology literature have shown that if kurtosis is non-negligible, as in the case of “fat-tailed” dispersal distributions (distributions whose tails are not exponentially bounded), the asymptotic behavior of the wave of advance changes so that the speed of the wave continually accelerates [32,33]. Because observed dispersal distributions for humans have been found to be leptokurtic (i.e., large kurtosis) [34], we considered the effect of a leptokurtic dispersal distribution on our results. We simulated the spread of an advantageous allele in a two-dimensional stepping stone model on a torus using three different dispersal distributions with varying degrees of kurtosis: a normal distribution, a double gamma distribution used by Cavalli-Sforza et al. [34] to fit human dispersal data, and a modified double exponential distribution used by Clark et al. [35] to describe fat-tailed seed dispersal data (see Table 1). These distributions were scaled to have a standard deviation of 100 km. We sampled data from the resulting spatial distributions of allele frequency, and estimated the ratio of dispersal to selection using the same method we applied to the Δ32 data. The results (Table 1) show that the effect of kurtosis on the estimates is very small: between all three distributions the estimates of R vary in a narrow range and the corresponding values of σ vary only between 98 and 110 km.\nWhile violations of each of these simplifying assumptions (no genetic drift, additivity of the selective effect, a diffusion approximation for dispersal) are unlikely to have important effects on our estimates, the variance introduced by violations may contribute to the overdispersion observed in the data and the significant G-test statistic we computed. Another likely cause of the unexplained variance is that our model does not explicitly incorporate specific historical events. Information about particularly important dispersal events will help refine quantitative models of the evolution of Δ32. However, a challenge to developing such models is the difficulty of keeping them from becoming too parameter-rich or overburdened with assumptions regarding historical demographic events [36].\nIn summary, we present an approach to analyzing the geographic distribution of a selected allele. The approach allows us to estimate the ratio of dispersal to selection as well as fit gradients in selection to the observed allele frequency data. Our analysis confirms Δ32 has been under strong selection, and furthermore shows that long-range dispersal and selection gradients have been important processes in determining the spread of this advantageous allele. The results provide an insight into the history of Δ32 and into the processes that affect the geographic spread of advantageous alleles in humans.\nWe focused our analysis on the region extending from 22°N to 75°N and 10°W to 154°E. Topographic data were obtained from the ETOPO5 data assembled by the National Geophysical Data Center. The exact dataset used was a version with 1° latitude/longitude resolution that is provided as a standard dataset in MATLAB 7. The coastline data were extracted by taking all values above sea level to be land. A land bridge between Denmark and Sweden was added to model migration between the two closely separated land masses. An image of the habitat is available as Figure S1.A summary of Δ32 allele frequency data was constructed by pooling data from multiple published papers [12,14,19,37–43]. Latitude and longitude for 58 of the 71 samples were kindly provided by S. Limborska. For the remainder of samples, we used either the latitude and longitude of the city where the sample was collected or the latitude and longitude of a major city in the region sampled. We excluded any data points that were obtained from land masses not connected to the European mainland in our model, as well as allele frequency estimates from Ashkenazi Jews because of the unique founder effects in their history [18]. The allele frequency data are provided in Table S1.To model the frequency of the Δ32 allele across Europe we used an approach based on Fisher's wave-of-advance theory [26]. The model is deterministic and based on a two-dimensional, nonlinear PDE. The PDE describes the function p(x,y,t), which represents the distribution of allele frequency across the xy plane at time t:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\twhere Δ(p) is a nonlinear function of p that represents the change in allele frequency due to selection. The coefficient σ2 denotes the variance of the parent–offspring dispersal distance distribution. To calculate Δ(p), we assume fitnesses of 1 + d, 1 + s, and 1 for the Δ32/Δ32, Δ32/+, and +/+ genotypes, respectively. For this parameterization of selection, standard deterministic theory [44] gives the following result:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTo incorporate gradients in selection, s and d are replaced with linear functions, denoted s(x,y) and d(x,y), respectively. In particular\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\twhere sc, xc, and yc represent the selection coefficient and the x and y coordinates of the center of the habitat, respectively. This approach does not limit s(x,y) to being positive; that is, if the gradient in selection is strong enough, portions of the range may have negative selection coefficients. The results presented here are limited to the assumption of additivity, so d(x,y) = 2s(x,y), although the results are not sensitive to the assumption regarding d (see Discussion).To represent the occurrence of the mutation at a single location in space with an initial local frequency of p0, we specified the initial conditions of the PDE solution to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\twhere δ(x,y) is a two-dimensional Dirac delta function, which takes on values close to one at x = 0 and y = 0, and values near zero for all other values of x and y. The value of p0 was calculated by the formula 1/D, where D is the initial population density. Population density only enters the model by determining the initial frequency. We generated results for D = 2.5 and D = 20. The two conditions correspond to published estimates of the population density in Europe at 1000 BCE and 1300 CE [30] and thus represent population density at the two orders of magnitude that are relevant for the origin of Δ32. The general results presented did not differ between D = 2.5 and D = 20, so we report results only for D = 2.5. For the boundary conditions, a model of reflecting boundaries was imposed. The assumption of reflecting boundaries is an implicit assumption that alleles are not lost or gained at the habitat boundaries.For the application of the equations to a geographic habitat, we set the x-axis to be latitude and the y-axis to be longitude. In the results we report σ in units of kilometers. For rendering the habitat we work in coordinates of degrees latitude and longitude, so a simple conversion is needed to change σ in units of kilometers to units of degrees latitude and longitude. To convert from units of latitude we employ the number of kilometers per degree latitude as the scaling coefficient, which is a constant 111 km per degree latitude. To account for the decreasing amount of geographic distance represented by 1° longitude as one moves north, σ in the longitudinal axis is converted by taking σ/m(x) where m(x) is the number of kilometers per degree longitude at latitude x. Without this correction, there would be a nearly 4-fold difference in latitudinal dispersal between the lower edge (22°N) and upper edge (75°N) of the range we considered. A similar correction is applied to s(x,y), d(x,y), and p0.To solve the PDE for p(x,y,t), we used an alternating-direction implicit approach with Crank–Nicholson updates at each time step [45]. In this approach, the continuous habitat is discretized into elements of length Δx and width Δy. Time is discretized into segments of length Δt, so that p(x,y,t) is represented by a three-dimensional matrix P(n) with elements P(n)j,k representing the value of p(x,y,t) at time nΔt at a point (jΔx,kΔy) relative to the origin. Δx and Δy were set to 1° of latitude and longitude, respectively. For the results presented here Δt was fixed at 0.005. Results were qualitatively similar for different values of Δx, Δy, and Δt, provided that all three were sufficiently small. The accuracy of numerical solutions was confirmed by comparison to analytical results that exist for simple geometries and linear selection pressures (results not shown).To model the frequency of Δ32 in Iceland, we used a standard single-population deterministic model of selection in which the additive selection intensity was set to s = 0.2 and the initial frequency was obtained from the PDE model. Specifically, the initial frequency was obtained by setting a selection Intensity of sc = 0.2 in the PDE model and recording the allele frequency at a representative location in Scandinavia (60°N 11°E) 44 generations (≈1,100 y) before the allele reaches 16% frequency. This approach neglects any possible founder effects associated with the founding of Iceland and any recurring migration between Iceland and mainland Europe. It also assumes the selection intensity in Iceland to be similar to that on the mainland.To obtain MLEs for the parameters of the model, we used a fixed allele age ta and supposed the number of Δ32 alleles observed at each sample locale arose as an independent binomial sample where the success probability at point (x,y) is determined by p(x,y,ta). The resulting likelihood function is\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThis likelihood approach benefits from taking into account the sample size at each sampling locale, so that the discrepancy between predicted and observed allele frequencies is penalized less at locations with smaller sample sizes. The value of ta used for the results was the time at which, given the other parameters, the maximum allele frequency first reached 16%, although using a value of 20% provided qualitatively similar results.A grid-based method was used to produce a joint likelihood surface over R, GNS, GEW, x0, and y0. We used a grid for R that had eight values between 2 × 104 and 2 × 106 spaced evenly on a logarithmic scale; a grid for the geographic origins x0 and y0 that contained the 29 locations indicated by the points in Figure 6; a grid for GNS that started at 0 and then covered from 1 × 10−5 to 22 × 10−5 with increments of 3 × 10−5; and a grid for GEW that included zero as well as a range from −17.5 × 10−5 to 17.5 × 10−5 with increments of 5 × 10−5. The resulting grid contained 14,848 points in the five dimensions of R, GNS, GEW, x0, and y0.To asses the goodness of fit of the model we performed a standard G-test. The G-test statistic can be formulated as 2(Ln −L5) where L5 is the log-likelihood computed using the MLE values in our full five-parameter diffusion-based model, and Ln is the log-likelihood computed using the observed sample frequencies as the respective population frequencies for the binomial distributions in the likelihood function (equation 5). For our dataset, Ln = −144.9 and L5 = −247.7. We also estimated the overdispersion parameter ϕ by the ratio of the G-test statistic to the number of degrees of freedom. Under the null hypothesis the estimate of the overdispersion parameter is expected to be one, and for large samples, values greater than one are indicative of overdispersion in the data.To evaluate the effect of kurtosis we used simulations on a two-dimensional stepping stone habitat of 121 × 121 demes placed on a torus-shaped habitat arranged in a uniform distribution on (−6,000 km, 6,000 km) along the x and y axes. The origin of the allele was chosen to be at x0 = 0 and y0 = 0, and the initial frequency of the allele was set to 10−5. The simulations were stopped when the allele frequency became greater than 16%. Selection was incorporated with an additive allele with s = 0.2. Dispersal was modeled using three dispersal distributions. Here, for simplicity, we present the one-dimensional version of each dispersal kernel. The two-dimensional distribution was found by assuming dispersal along each axis was probabilistically independent and taking the products of the corresponding one-dimensional distributions. The first distribution was a mean-zero Gaussian distribution:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe second was a modified double exponential that when c < 1 is not exponentially bounded, and thus qualifies as a fat-tailed dispersal distribution:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe third was a double gamma distribution that was used by Cavalli-Sforza et al. [34] to fit historical data on human dispersal:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAll three distributions were parameterized to have a standard deviation equal to 100 km, so that the effect of kurtosis alone could be assessed. For the shape parameter of the double gamma distribution we used the value of 0.0419 estimated by Cavalli-Sforza et al. [34] for human historical data. The resulting double gamma distribution had a kurtosis of 146.2. For the modified double exponential distribution, we used a shape parameter (c = 1/2) that gives reasonable kurtosis (K = 25.2) and guarantees the tails of the distribution are not exponentially bounded. The resulting allele frequency surfaces were binomially sampled at 49 evenly spaced locations with samples of size 120 to construct a simulated allele frequency dataset. The data were then passed to the likelihood-based method used on the Δ32 data but with GNS, GEW, x0, and y0 all fixed to zero, so that R was the only parameter to estimate. For the grid search we used a grid of R values with nine points from 3.3 × 104 to 1 × 105. The mean and standard error for estimates of R and σ reported in Table 1 are the average of ten replicates for each dispersal distribution."

            "fulltext": "IntroductionThe world has become an increasingly interconnected system with multi-scale geographically embedded networks (i.e., transportation, internet). Spatial analysis aims to understand such systems in terms of spatial patterns, relationships, processes, and change within and among geographical spaces [1]. Social network analysis has been used to understand how systems emerge through the interaction of individual agents (i.e., humans, companies). Both approaches have advantages and limitations as methods through which to understand the complex geo-social interconnected world. Many geo-social interconnected systems mainly grow from the bottom-up, but traditional spatial analysis is a top-down approach that cannot deal with the evolution of the systems over space and time [2], [3]. Social network analysis, a bottom-up approach, can link individual-level behaviors and interactions to the emergence of social phenomena [4], but the approach typically ignores geographical constraints [5]. An effective integration of both approaches has the potential to aid understanding of geo-social systems from a more comprehensive perspective. For example, the integration of spatial consideration into a social network approach enables understanding of why and how an air-borne disease diffuses within an urban area in a manner that can generate disease hot spots as well as cold spots [6]. The integration of spatial analysis and social network analysis has the potential to link individual-level behaviors and interactions (i.e., human, vehicle, organization) to understand urban sprawl over space and time [4]. Although spatial analysis and social network analysis have the potential to complement each other, the formal integration of two approaches remains relatively underdeveloped in the literature [7].\nThis paper therefore integrates spatial analysis and social network analysis into a unified framework through a geovisual analytics approach. Geovisual analytics tools integrate computational methods with interactive visualization, in order to enable insights on large and complex geospatial datasets [8], [9], [10], [11]. Specifically, we present and apply a geovisual analytics tool, GeoSocialApp [12], that consists of three major analytical “spaces” implemented as linked components: a geographic space, a network space, and an attribute space. Each performs a specific task and can coordinate with other components to facilitate a process through which insights are enabled. We illustrate how the GeoSocialApp facilitates development of hypotheses, with the international trade network (ITN) as a case study. The explicit geographical and network representations in the GeoSocialApp facilitate and enable insight in terms of different roles that spatial and social relationships have in the ITN across geographical regions with network hierarchies at different scales. One major goal of geovisual analytics is to develop hypotheses on how space matters based on the patterns identified from geo-spatial data [13]; but the validation of geovisual analytics results is still regarded as a challenge [14]. Here, we propose a Monte-Carlo approach as a statistical validation to support the hypothesis developed through visual-computational exploration of spatial and social interaction in the ITN.\nThe paper begins below by reviewing the development of geo-social visual analytics methods in geography and network domains (Section 2). We then present an overview of the methods (Section 3) and the international trade network data used in this study (Section 4). The results obtained through applying the methods to the data (Section 4) provide insights on the different roles that spatial and social relationships play in relation to trade across geographical regions (Section 5). We next introduce the Monte-Carlo approach as a statistical validation to support the insights discussed in section 5 (Section 6). Finally, we present conclusions and an outlook for future research (Section 7).\nLiterature ReviewCurrent geo-social visual analytics tools can be classified into two major groups: the first group, rooted in geography, focuses on geographical analysis with an implicitly network representation; the second group, rooted in social network science, has an explicitly network representation with geography as a background to visualize the results. This section reviews the geo-social visual analytics tools from geography and social network science domains, and argues for a more balanced approach that emphasizes spatial relationships and social networks simultaneously.\nSpatial interactions/flows associated with topics such as human migration and disease transmission are major research domains for integrating network representation into geovisual analytics. For example, Andrienko and Andrienko [15] develop a spatial generalization method to transform trajectories with common origins and destinations into aggregated flows maintaining essential characteristics of the movement between areas. In complementary research, Guo [16] proposes an integrated interactive visualization framework that is applied to county-to-county migration data in the U.S. in order to visualize and discover network structures, multivariate relations, and their geographic patterns simultaneously. Additional relevant research can be found in recent papers by Andrienko et al. [17], Demšar and Virrantaus [18], Guo, Liu and Jin [19], and Wood, Dykes and Slingsby [20].\nAll of the above studies consider the geo-social processes from a primarily geographical perspective. Spatial interactions/flows in research taking this perspective are typically visualized on maps, which provide important information on spatial context. The observed spatial patterns can be related to the spatial context (e.g., big cities tend to be hotspots for human interaction). The methods for geo-social interaction discussed so far assume that geographic locations define the geo-social process, but new communication and transportation technologies clearly spread social networks beyond traditional geographical constraints (i.e., distance) [21]. Therefore, understanding the social meaning behind the geo-social processes is equally important.\nGeo-social visual analytics from a social network science perspective tends to have an explicit network context with an implicitly geographical representation. Ahmed et al. [22] introduce new visual analysis methods with dynamic network views (e.g., wheel layout, radial layout, and hierarchical layout) to explore the 2006 International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) World Cup competition in which countries are clustered based on their geographical locations in the dynamic graph representation. The visual analysis methods allow users to analyze and compare each country's performance within the geo-social context. The explicit network representation and implicitly geographical representation require analysts to relate the explicit network representation to his or her unrepresented geographic background knowledge in the visually interactive process [8]. Thiemann [23] developed the SPaTo Visual Explorer, which implements multiple explicitly geographical and network representations. Using a case study focused on global air flight networks, he illustrates how SPaTo can allow users to develop hypotheses about the interaction between geographical distance and social network distance. For example, they derive evidence showing that geographical proximity of cities corresponds with short social distance among the cities. Beyond the above, four additional research efforts have focused on specific components of methods to involve explicitly geographical representations into a traditional social network approach: 1) spatial point pattern exploration approach (e.g., kernel density) can be used to understand spatial impacts on the development of social networks [24]; 2) spatial autocorrelation coefficient (e.g., Moran's I) has been applied to social networks to measure the statistical similarity of individuals [25]; 3) explicitly spatial representations facilitate practical implementation of decision-making in certain social network application domains (e.g., infectious disease control) [26]; and 4) certain geo-social systems (e.g., human migration, international trade network) can be better understood or predicted through mathematical models considering physical and social space [27], [28].\nAs discussed above, understanding geo-social systems requires consideration of both geographical relationships and social network relationships. Therefore, it is necessary to involve explicitly geographical and social network representations. Andris [29] lists five benefits to having an explicit network representation within a geo-spatial framework: 1) the group of connected geographical regions can be studied as a unit with social closeness based on a network community detection approach; 2) the social power of places can be represented by node measures (i.e., degree, betweenness); 3) the social role of interconnected places over the whole system can be represented by network system measures (i.e., degree distribution, betweenness distribution); 4) the complex social interaction between places can be understood through adding multiple social flow layers on Geographical Information System (GIS); and 5) the geo-social systems in which spatial closeness and social closeness do not match can be better modeled with an explicit network representation.\nThe above discussion illustrates that there is the lack of explicitly spatial and social network representations in current geovisual analytics and the importance of such representations to understand geo-social systems [30]. It is also still a challenge to statistically support the hypotheses developed through visual exploration [31], particularly the hypotheses directed to geo-social interaction. To fill the gap, this paper introduces the GeoSocialApp with the 2005 international trade network as a case study to understand the interaction between spatial and social relationships, and introduces the use of a Monte-Carlo approach to validate the hypothesis developed in our geo-social visual exploration.\nMethodsIn this paper, we extend and apply the GeoSocialApp, a geovisual analytics tool initially introduced in preliminary form in Luo et al. [12]. The GeoSocialApp implements traditional network analysis methods within the context of an environment that links explicitly spatial and social representations to understand the interaction of spatial and social relationships in the ITN. The GeoSocialApp is an extension of the GeoViz Toolkit (GVT) developed in the GeoVISTA Center at Penn State [32]. The research presented here makes use of the existing choropleth mapping capabilities of GVT to support geographical analysis as well as the component coordination methods that enable dynamic linking and brushing across views, and adds a dendrogram component that supports multiple graph-based views to represent a varying network hierarchy. Details about other GVT components that could be used to extend the analysis presented here can be found in http://www.geovista.psu.edu/GeoSocialApp​/ (The source code for the GeoSocialApp is open source under the Library General Public License, version 2 (LGPL 2.0). We plan a public release of a binary version usable by non-programmers in the future).\nAs noted above, we use two components in the GeoSocialApp for this study: a dendrogram view and a choropleth view. The dendrogram view implements the convergence of the iterated correlations (CONCOR) algorithm [33], [34] to group nodes with equivalent positions in a single network or multiple social networks together. Equivalent positions refer to collections of actors that have similar ties to and from all other actors in the network. The implication of actors having equivalent positions is that they play similar social roles in a relational network. We can describe the relational network by an adjacency matrix A, which can generate a position similarity matrix R to measure the equivalent positions, whose element value rij is defined as:(1)where is the mean of the values in row i (j) of the matrix A and is the mean of the values in column i (j) of the matrix A. At the initial level of analysis, CONCOR performs the above equation calculations iteratively on the position similarity matrix R until all values converge to either 1 or −1, resulting in all nodes being grouped into one of two categories. Two groups can be too generalized for some studies, so hierarchical structures can be achieved by running CONCOR on each subgroup. In this way, CONCOR can continue to split nodes into successively smaller groups: two become four, four become eight, and so on. Although this algorithm was developed originally for application to social networks of individuals, it has been demonstrated to be an effective method to empirically locate structural positions in terms of the ITN [12], [35].Equivalent positions in terms of the ITN refer to collections of countries that have a similar import and export trade relationships with all other countries [36]. The implication of countries having equivalent positions is that they play similar social roles in the ITN. According to world system theory, the economic development of different countries is affected by their structural positions: core, semi-periphery, and periphery through unequal economic exchanges among them [37]. Core countries focus on capital-intensive production, periphery countries provide low-skill labor and raw materials, and semi-periphery countries are the industrializing countries positioned between the periphery and core countries. The CONCOR algorithm can classify the ITN into these three structural equivalence positions [38], [39].A tree layout and a radial layout are implemented in the dendrogram view to visualize the hierarchical structure of CONCOR results (Figure 1). The tree layout organizes the graph in a hierarchical way by placing child nodes under their common ancestors. An informationally equivalent radial view can be transformed from the tree by putting child nodes in the enclosing circle of their common ancestors [40], [41]. The dendrogram view in the GeoSocialApp also provides a slider to control the hierarchical level of CONCOR results.The dendrogram view of social space is dynamically linked to a choropleth map view used for visual exploration in geographical space. Each node in the dendrogram view corresponds to a geographical unit (i.e., states, countries) in the choropleth map. The choropleth map allows users to choose the number of classes, the classification method (i.e., equal intervals, quantiles), the variable to display, and the ColorBrewer palette [42] for color selection. Thus, the linked dendrogram and map views allow exploration of social positions and social groups and their corresponding spatial positions and spatial groups simultaneously. With the hierarchical level control in the dendrogram view, the linked views further support the explicit exploration of interaction between social space and geographical space and its impact on outcomes of interest at different network hierarchy (Figure 2). This capability will be illustrated in the case study presented below, after the data used in that case study are first described."

            "fulltext": "IntroductionIn atmospheric sciences Equivalent Latitude () is a Lagrangian coordinate defined as the geographical latitude enclosing the same area as the isoline of a given atmospheric field on a 2D (longitude by latitude) surface [1], [2]. It is computed as:: radius of the sphere (e.g. Earth's radius).\nTherefore computing  is simply the problem of computing the area  enclosed by the isoline of the studied property, which is essentially the determination of a function from a subset of data points.\nOne common technique to compute  works by assuming the value of the atmospheric field to be constant within each grid cell (hereafter the ‘piecewise-constant’ method). To determine  for a given threshold value of the field, you simply sum the areas for all grid cells with field values less than the threshold value.: value of the field. : value to be evaluated. : grid cell.\nThe piecewise-constant approach is only first-order accurate, not allowing the atmospheric field to vary across the cell. Increased accuracy could be attained by higher-order approximations for the field variation (e.g., linear, parabolic, cubic interpolation). In this paper, we develop a higher-order solution to the problem of calculating  by using contour mapping techniques. This approach, known also as regions of interest (ROI), is a well known concept in medical imaging and is also used for geographical information systems. The general approach involves defining a region from a field (up to 4D), which is selected for a posteriori analysis. That is, given a field or sample, a subsample is selected which meets certain properties and that is the region in which we are interested for further analysis. Here we limit the field variation to the surface of a sphere (2D). The use of ROI based on interpolated contours is more accurate than the piecewise-constant method, since it is a better approximation to the real function (exact area). This is illustrated in figure 1, which maps the areas enclosed by a threshold value of potential vorticity (PV) using both the piecewise-constant and ROI methods. This is an advantage when considering, for example, small isolated and closed contours, since the size of the grid becomes more important in order to take them into account or not. For example, the ROI method is more accurate to assess the real area of a closed contour when it is slightly smaller or bigger than a cell or subset of cells of the grid.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.  Comparison between the area used for the computation of  by the piecewise-constant method (gray surface) and the ROI technique (surface inside red contours) for a grid size of 2.5°×2.5°.The case corresponds to 1 January 1990 at OO UTC from NCEP1 for 2 PVU on an isentropic surface of 380 K.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0072970.g001In this paper we explore the ROI technique for the computation of  and compare the performance and accuracy with that obtained using the piecewise-constant method. For the purposes of this paper the ROI will be a 2D field of atmospheric PV [3], usually measured in PV units (PVU), where . The reason for this choice is that computation of  from PV is commonly used in atmospheric sciences, applied for example to the study of the stratospheric polar vortex [4], [5], and the goal for which we originally developed this approach. The differences between both techniques and, explained in a basic way, the steps that we follow are:\n\n\n\n\npiecewise-constant technique (traditional):\n\n\n\nPV is assumed to be constant within each grid cell;\n\ncompute the area of each cell which value is less than the PV threshold that we are interested in;\n\nsum the area of the cells from step 2\n\n\n\nROI technique:\n\n\n\nPV is ‘not’ constant within each grid cell;\n\nmake the contour mapping function ‘draw’ (interpolate) the isolines of PV;\n\ncompute the area enclosed by the isoline corresponding to the PV threshold value that we are interested in;\n\n\n\nWe developed the ROI code using the Interactive Data Language (IDL), a programming language extensively used for research in atmospheric sciences [6], and compare with piecewise-constant code also written in IDL. In this way we put the focus on the code and the technique, and do not take into account any dependence on programming language, corresponding libraries, or dependencies on hardware.\nThe following section describes the data used followed by the design and implementation of the ROI routine, addressing the ways in which we have solved the shortcomings of the computer language and subroutines affecting our implementation. This is followed by a results section that details the accuracy and performance of the ROI method relative to the piecewise-constant method. To conclude, we briefly discuss several ways of improving the solution here proposed, including using another programming languages and language interpreters.\nMaterials and Methods\nPrevious code and data\nRoutines to compute  are available through internet, e.g. the ones using the NCAR Command Language (http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Applications/equ​iv_lat.shtml) or pascal (http://www.bodekerscientific.com/how-do-​i/calculate-equivalent-latitude). To check our new methodology against the more traditional one, we use the code (not previously published) supplied as (file S1) that applies the piecewise-constant method. This code takes as input a global gridded field with supplied latitude and longitude grids along with a desired threshold value of the field at which  is calculated. The grid cells are sorted by the value of the field in each cell, and  is calculated for every grid point on the globe.  is then interpolated to the desired threshold value and is output to the user.

Flow diagram corresponding to the piecewise-constant code.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0072970.g002We have tested our new ROI routine using fields of PV computed for five sets of reanalyzed data (NCEP/NCAR (hereafter NCEP1) [7], NCEP/DOE (hereafter NCEP2) [8], JRA-25 [9], ERA-Interim [10]), MERRA [11] and one chemistry-climate model (WACCM3 [12]). Additional information about the computation of the fields of PV, the datasets and results obtained with this routine can be obtained from Añel et al. [13].\n\n\nDesign and Implementation\nThe method here proposed is based on a simple idea: given the field that we want to study (PV), we just need to plot it using a global contour map and then to make use of the IDL tools to detect what parts of the field meet a criterion (in our case that the value is below a given PVU threshold). Then the area that meets the criterion is automatically computed by the ROI detection tools avilable in IDL and we just need to apply the corresponding equation to get .\nThe first problem to be solved for the implementation of the computation of the area using ROI is to determine the configuration of a given isoline of a global field projected on a sphere (the planet). Depicting the field with a cylindrical projection, an isosurface of PV can show three different configurations, directly related to the shape of the isolines over this projection (see figure 3):\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 3.  Upper left: global isosurface of 4 PVU on 1 January 1990 from ERA-Interim reanalysis data.Upper right:  corresponding to the area covered by the 4 PVU isosurface (in this case 30.41°). Lower panel: cylindrical projection corresponding to the upper left panel.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0072970.g003\n\n\n\ncase 1: contours closed for any region of the planet, the easiest problem as it requires just applying the computation of the area using the available routines for ROI;\n\ncase 2: contours going through the meridian 180 and not enclosing the pole are not closed in a cylindrical projection, so they need to be split in two different contours (one in each hemisphere) and the area has to be computed as the sum of the two different areas;\n\ncase 3: the contours around the poles are not closed in a cylindrical projection. They go from the the lowest to the highest value in longitude. They are closed using a large number of points (resolution of 0.1°) at the latitude near the pole (North or South) and then the enclosing area is calculated using routines for ROI.\n\nAnother problem addressed during the design of this code was that the computation of ROI in IDL gives erroneous negative values if one line of the isolines of PV drawn by the function ‘contour’ crosses itself. This happens mainly for latitudes near to the poles in rectangular grids where cell size and isolines get narrow and the IDL ROI implementation fails for unknown reasons. We solve this problem by increasing the latitudinal resolution in these regions, studying the ROI with a resolution of 0.1° to avoid the problem of crossing isolines.\nIt was also necessary to create new matrix of data in order to close the contours not closed in the cylindrical projection, just because for example they cut the meridian zero as we mentioned before. An additional problem was discovered for the computation of cosines for 90° and −90°. IDL presents a bug and the results are negative values instead of zero. To avoid this problem we close the contours in a latitude of 89.99° instead of 90°.\nThe IDLanROI class is used to determine the regions enclosing specified threshold values of PV, and it is combined with the application of the ‘path_info’ keyword in the Contour procedure. Also we had to take into account the difference between computation of the geometric area (the real value of the mathematical calculation) and the masked region (value from the pixels in the displayed area) when using ROI in IDL. Therefore we applied the ComputeGeometry function to obtain the geometric area. ComputeGeometry relies on the Contour procedure to get the function.\nFinally, the total area to be passed to the routine to compute the equivalent latitude is considered as the addition of the values for the different partial areas obtained. We use −9999.99 for the total area when (according to ‘path_info’) there is not a corresponding contour for the threshold PV value that we try to evaluate.\nThe process is explained in a flow diagram in the figure 4 and the ROI routine is included in file S2.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 4.  Flow diagram corresponding to the ROI code.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0072970.g004\nResults\nPrecision\nFirst, we checked that the ROI methodology produces reasonable results for  at all latitudes and for different isentropic surfaces. Figure 5 shows  calculated from ERA-Interim PV data on 1 January 1990 using both the piecewise-constant and ROI methods from 340 to 420 K potential temperature. It is clear that the two methods produce very similar results, although there are some differences (e.g., near 40°S at 340 K).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 5.  Comparison of PVU values for several isentropic surfaces and corresponding to different .Values computed using the piecewise-constant and ROI methods on 1 January 1990 from ERA-Interim data.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0072970.g005Next, in order to check the accuracy of both methods we computated  for two different cases in which the PV field is not based on real data, but rather on an analytic function ( and , so that we know the exact relationship between  and PV. For the first case, the PV isolines form perfect circles around the pole and  is simply equal to PV*10. In the second case we simply obtain a wavy field, but the relationship between  and PV is the same. The PV fields generated in this way are then used as input for both methods and the results are compared. Figure 6 shows the results using the piecewise-constant and ROI routines for the first method and figure 7 for both of them. Also the tables 1 and 2 quantify the variation of the error for different grid sizes. As it can be seen for a grid of 1.5°×1.5° the piecewise-constant method shows a bias respect to the corresponding  around a half degree for the first analytic function and 0.75 for the second one. This is greater than the bias for the ROI technique. Moreover the accuracy of the piecewise-constant method depends much more on the size of the grid (see both tables and figure 7).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 6.

This is something to have into account as in the future we probably will be moving to smaller grid sizes. This result is probably because the piecewise-constant method relies for the evaluation of the values of the function in each point on several FOR loops, which makes especially slow any computation in IDL. However the ROI technique simply computes the function once.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 3.

Also, currently is not possible to use the code based on ROI with GNUdatalanguage (http://gnudatalanguage.sourceforge.net), a free IDL compiler, as computation of ROI is not implemented in it."

                "\nThe Tagaeri Taromenane People are two indigenous groups belonging to the Waorani first nation living in voluntary isolation within the Napo region of the western Amazon rainforest. To protect their territory the Ecuadorean State has declared and geographically defined, by Decrees, the Zona Intangible Tagaeri Taromenane (ZITT). This zone is located within the UNESCO Yasuní Biosphere Reserve (1989), one of the most biodiverse areas in the world. Due to several hydrocarbon reserve exploitation projects running in the area and the advancing of a large-scale deforestation front, the survival of these groups is presently at risk. The general aim was to validate the ZITT boundary using the geographical references included in the Decree 2187 (2007) by analyzing the geomorphological characteristics of the area. Remote sensing data such as Digital Elevation Models (DEM), Landsat imagery, topographic cartography of IGM-Ecuador, and fieldwork geographical data have been integrated and processed by Geographical Information System (GIS). The ZITT presents two levels of geographic inconsistencies. The first dimension is about the serious cartographical weaknesses in the perimeter delimitation related to the impossibility of linking two rivers belonging to different basins while the second deals with the perimeter line not respecting the hydrographic network. The GIS analysis results clearly show that ZITT boundary is cartographically nonsense due to the impossibility of mapping out the perimeter. Furthermore, GIS analysis of anthropological data shows presence of Tagaeri Taromenane clans outside the ZITT perimeter, within oil production areas and in nearby farmer settlements, reflecting the limits of protection policies for non-contacted indigenous territory. The delimitation of the ZITT followed a traditional pattern of geometric boundary not taking into account the nomadic characteristic of Tagaeri Taromenane: it is necessary to adopt geographical approaches to recognize the indigenous right to their liveable territories in the complex territorialities enacted by different stakeholders.\n"

            "fulltext": "IntroductionThe Tagaeri Taromenane are two indigenous groups living in “Voluntary Isolation” in the Napo Moist terrestrial ecoregion, located in the western Amazon rainforest [1]–[5]. This ecoregion is one of the most biologically and culturally diverse areas on the planet [6], [7] representing an extraordinary richness across several taxa (amphibian, mammal, bird and plants), a high level of regional endemism [8]–[10], and is home to several indigenous ethnic groups including some of the world's last uncontacted peoples [11].\nThe Tagaeri Taromenane are settled in the Ecuadorean Amazon Region between the Yasuní and Curaray rivers and within the ancestral territory of the Waorani (or Huaorani) indigenous first nation [12], [13].\nTo protect the territory of these uncontacted indigenous people in the Yasuní Biosphere Reserve, the national government declared (1999) and mapped (2007), through two Presidential Decrees, the “No-Go-Zone” called Intangible Zone or Zona Intangible Tagaeri Taromenane (ZITT) [14], [15].\nDecree 2187 of 2007 represents the first official text that uniquely gives, using a geographical language, spatially explicit information to define the perimeter of ZITT.\nThe boundary of the ZITT is clamped onto 17 univocal points geographically expressed by pairs of metrical coordinates declared in the Decree 2187 (Figure 1A). To map the borders of the ZITT it is required to join the pairs of coordinates by rectilinear segments and by sections of river courses according to the geomorphological descriptions included in the Decree 2187.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.  Yasuní Biosphere Reserve and Zona Intangible Tagaeri Taromenane (ZITT): geographical framework.A) Delimitation of the Zona Intangible by given geographical coordinates and critical hotspots (red circles); B) Oil production in the Ecuadorian Amazon Region (9th concession licensing round, 2001).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0066293.g001Due to different interpretations of the geographical references expressed in the Decree 2187 and to the complex geomorphological characteristics of the Amazon sub-basins, different map representations of the ZITT are demarcated both in the official and unofficial cartography of the Yasuní Biosphere Reserve [16]–[20].\nSeveral studies about the ZITT and the issue on the uncontacted indigenous groups have been produced using mainly social and anthropological approaches [2], [3], [12], [13], [21]–[25]. No geographical studies and GIS spatial analysis on the ZITT have been produced in the scientific literature.\nFieldwork activities in the Yasuní Biosphere Reserve, geographical analysis of the Decree 2187, and studies on geomorphological characteristics of the area suggested the hypothesis that the official boundary of the ZITT is cartographically inaccurate with serious geographical inconsistencies along the perimeter.\nCrucial geographical inconsistencies seem localized between points No. 6 and No. 7 and between No.7 and No. 8.\nThe general aim of this paper is to validate the boundary using the geographical references expressed in the Decree 2187 of 2007 by analyzing the geomorphological characteristics of the area in order to re-map the perimeter of the ZITT through spatial and remote sensing analysis.\nThe GIS analysis results clearly show geographical incoherencies in two hotspots of the Yasuní and unequivocally demonstrate the impossibility to map the perimeter of the ZITT.\nAnalyses of both anthropological geospatial data about the Tagaeri Taromenane and their spatial relationships with extractive activities and roads confirm the existence of uncontacted groups in a wider area crossing oil fields and farmer settlements outside the same boundary of the Zona Intangible.\nFurthermore, violent contacts between Tagaeri Taromenane group and external mestizo farmers within the territory district of Dayuma (close to the Hormiguero extractive platform and the Armadillo oil field in 2009) [26]–[28] and maybe with Waorani relative (in 2013 within oil block 16, near the Maxus Road) happened in the area of Yasuní. Between the 4th and 5th of March 2013 two old Waorani were speared to death. The attack is under investigation by Ecuadorian Authorities to confirm responsibility of Tagaeri Taromenane groups [29]. These facts confirmed once more the presence of the Tagaeri Taromenane also outside the ZITT perimeter (Figures S1, S2), fuelling a hot debate inside national society questioning the relationship among the majority and minorities and asking for a different way of conceiving territories: from the Westphalian rigid geometry to a geographic network of cultural and environmental relationships.\n\nThe overlapping systems of territorial complexities\nThrough the Man and Biosphere Program, the United Nation's Agency UNESCO included this geographical area into the Biosphere Reserve network (1989), declaring the Yasuní National Park and the land-titled of Waorani territory (known as Waorani Ethnic Reserve) as Yasuní Biosphere Reserve. It was added in order to prioritize and to conciliate biodiversity conservation with sustainable development in the territory planning [30], [31].\nHowever, due to huge non-renewable energy reserves and to the crucial role they play in the national economy [32]–[34], the Ecuadorean State zoned specific geographical areas in the Amazon Region for hydrocarbon industrial activities – the so called “oil blocks” – so that, according to the 9th licensing round established in 2001, roughly the 79% of the YBR [35]–[37] was overlapped by concessions for oil extraction and production (Figure 1B) [38].\nOil development in the Ecuadorian Amazon (Figure 1B) has already directly and indirectly caused major social and environmental change to the Amazon people and ecosystems. Direct effects include deforestation for drilling platforms, pipelines, access roads, seismic prospecting activities, and chemical contamination of water bodies from wastewater discharges, oil spills and gas emissions [39]–[43]. Indirect effects are related to the opening of roads for oil exploration and transportation which turns terrestrial communications infrastructures into the main vector for colonization of primary forest [44]–[46], represented by the Moist Tropical Forest. Colonization of Moist Tropical Forest is causing increased deforestation as well as logging and hunting from human settlements [47]–[50]. As it is interpreted by the satellite image of the Via Auca Road (Landsat ETM+, 2002; Figure S1) – the most important oil terrestrial infrastructure at the western sector of the Yasuní Biosphere Reserve – colonization processes of the forests are usually driven by the main road axis [51]. They represent the main driver of extensive deforestation activity traced out by orthogonal and parallel processes resulting in land cover/land use change dynamics in the typical deforestation spatial pattern called fish-bone (Figure S1) [52]–[56]. Moreover, rapid expansion of Via Auca road system to the west underlies direct anthropogenic pressure to Tagaeri Taromenane mobility space [38]. Previous GIS analysis by processing GPS data of the Via Auca road network showed, between 2009 and 2012, a spatial evolution to the west of 100 linear km (Figure S2) [38], [57]. Land use and land cover change dynamics result in agricultural activities both at intensive cultivation level (i.e. African Palm, Elaeis guineensis bot. sp.) and non-traditional farming (Figures S1, S2).\nTherefore, hydrocarbon reserves exploitation, by its direct and indirect impacts on tropical forest ecosystems, played a pivotal role in turning the Napo ecoregion into one of the 14 mayor deforestation fronts in the world [58]–[60].\nThis set of socio-environmental processes taking place in the Ecuadorian Amazon (especially in the Auca territory system) is also affecting the social reproduction and the same survival of the Tagaeri Taromenane, clans of uncontacted hunters, and collectors living by semi-nomadic lifestyle in a wide territory of the Yasuní Biosphere Reserve's western and southern sector [3], [13], [61].\nAdditionally, in the last decades, several violent contacts between uncontacted indigenous people and external stakeholders induced the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR, 2006) to grant precautionary measures in favor of the Tagaeri Taromenane demanding that “the Ecuadorian State adopt measures necessary to protect the territory inhabited by beneficiaries from third parties” [62].\nThe institutional history of the Intangible Zones began in the 1999 by the Decree 552, declaring the Zona Intangible to protect the territory of the uncontacted Tagaeri Taromenane indigenous groups. This Decree stated to identify and geographically define the ZITT within a time range of 120 days from the 2nd of February 1999 [14]. After 4 years, by the Inter-ministerial Agreement 092, a Technical Commission was saddled with establishing the perimeter of the ZITT (Quito, 2004) along with the task of identifying criteria including the integration of monitoring and controlling systems of the area [63]. The delimitation of the ZITT has been a long and controversial process [2], [64] complicated by the fact that this area is “geographically embedded” within the industrial concession areas for oil exploitation [65]. On the north and west sides, there are oil companies operating in industrial production for the past three decades while on the south side there are the exploratory blocks which represent, by the 11th licensing round opened in November 2012 [66], a spatial shift to the Southern Amazonian sector of the extractive frontier (Figure 1B) [67]–[70].\nFinally, a geographic delimitation of the ZITT was issued on the 16th of January 2007 through the Decree 2187 signed by the President of the Republic Alfredo Palacio [15]. To mitigate external anthropic influences, a buffer zone of 10 km has been defined around its perimeter. Within this additional protected area, wood extraction activities and new oil concessions are forbidden, while traditional activities such as hunting, fishing, and traditional use of biodiversity is allowed to the ancestral indigenous communities (the Waorani first nation) (Art. 2, Decree 2187) [15].\nAccording to the Ecuadorean Decree the Intangible Zones are defined as “protected areas of high cultural and biological importance in which whatever extractive activities are forbidden due to its high value for the Amazon rainforest, Ecuador, the World and the present and future generations” (1999, Presidencia de la Repubblica) [71]. It is therefore an “untouchable zone” in which oil, gas, and other external anthropic activities must be off limits.\nThe ZITT is also a crucial issue because it is related to the “Yasuní-ITT initiative” undertaken by the Ecuadorean Government (2007) [72]–[74], an international initiative oriented to protect biodiversity, recognize indigenous peoples' territory, and contrast climate change. The “Yasuní-ITT Initiative” proposal aims to keep locked underground, in perpetuity, at least 850 million barrels of heavy crude oil. This will prevent the emission of CO2 associated with burning fossil fuels of about 410 million metric tons of out of the atmosphere, in exchange of financial compensation from the developed countries concerned about tropical deforestation and climate change [75], [76].\n\nResults and Discussion\nCartographic analysis of the 17 vertex coordinates\nThe boundary of the ZITT is cartographically defined by Art. 1 of Decree 2187. The perimeter is spatially determined by 17 given points expressed by metric coordinates (UTM projection, zone 18, PSAD1956 geographic projection system) which have been cartographically validated. They are all geographically plausible and do not have any transcription errors. On the one side, all of the 17 vertex coordinates are consistent both with the geomorphological description and the measurements of straight lines included in the text of Decree 2187; however, on the other side sections of river courses linking vertex coordinates are in some segments ambiguous. In the latter case, mapping out the boundary becomes more complicated.\nMarking out river segments of the ZITT boundary imply the use large scale maps (1:50,000 or 1:25,000), including a detailed representation of hydrographic networks, the relief system, and toponyms. Due to a complex and vast territory characterized by the typical Moist Tropical Forest land cover and by a hydrographic system evolving into a very dense network, geographic interpretation could be difficult for cartographers since it is easily prone to cartographic errors.\nCartographic delimitation of the ZITT starts from point No. 1 which reaches by a straight line point No. 2. From here the boundary overlaps the Cononaco Chico River to the north until point No. 3. This segment of the limit is short (4,550 meters) and it does not create any problems of interpretation due to the importance of this river which is well represented in the cartography production of IGM. From point No. 3 to No. 4, the boundary is marked out by a straight line of 6,140 meters according to the given coordinates. The border continues from point No. 4 to No. 5 again by a straight line. From point No. 5 to No. 6 the perimeter line follows once again a straight line “till reaching the confluence of two tributaries of the Rio Bahameno in point No. 6, having 9892355 North and 339450 Este” (2nd indent, Art. 1, Decree. 2187) (Document S1). We noticed that, although the linear distance between these points is consistent to the values of the given coordinates (Table S1) and point No. 6 exactly lies on a river confluence, the two tributaries do not belong to the Rio Bahameno but to the Rio Dicaro (Figure 2, 3). As a matter of fact, it is the same geomorphological description in the official text stating that from point No. 6 the boundary follows the Rio Dicaro downstream in the east direction.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 2.

Digital Elevation Model (SRTM) in the area of points No. 5 and 6.DEM analysis of river basins and catchment's divides: Rio Dicaro and Rio Nashiño belong to different basins: the first one flows into the Yasuní River, the second one into the Curaray River. Therefore “following downstream the Rio Dicaro till point No. 7 by the Rio Nashiño” (Art. 1, indent 3) [15] becomes a “geographical nonsense” in mapping out the perimeter section from points No. 6 to that No. 7.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0066293.g003The most controversial part has been identified in the perimeter section between point No. 6 and No. 7: “(the boundary) follows to East direction by the Rio Dicaro course, then it runs downstream by the Rio Nashiño till reaching point No. 7” (3rd indent, Decree 2187) (Document S1) [15]. As mentioned above, the ZITT limit runs downstream along the Rio Dicaro in the east direction. Once proved that point No. 6 matches up with the riverbed of the Rio Dicaro (not the Rio Bahameno) and point No. 7 properly overlies the Rio Bahameno, it is important to understand how it has been operated the leap of river basins. It is clear that the Rio Dicaro and Rio Nashiño belong to two different river basins. The first one flows into the Rio Yasuní and the second into the Rio Curaray.\nAssuming the linear distance between point No. 6 and No. 7 is about 23,300 meters (Table S1), this particular step of the Decree 2187 technically gives infinite solutions. Therefore, if there is no better explanation, this perimeter section becomes cartographically unresolved. In any case, it is not possible to follow downstream the Rio Dicaro until point No. 7. This discrepancy results in geomorphological inconsistencies if it is not made explicit where to leave the Rio Dicaro course.\nFrom point No. 7 to No. 8 the boundary follows the river course of Rio Nashiño. The distance corresponds to more than 50 km (Table S1). From this point the limit continues until point No. 9 by a straight line approximately 20.6 km to the north-east direction, according to the values of coordinates declared in the Decree 2187.\nFrom point No. 9 to No. 10 the ZITT perimeter follows the river course of Rio Yasuní and from that point by a straight line of 6,850 meters reaches point No. 11. This point coincides to the same state border between Ecuador and Peru.\nFrom point No. 11 to that No. 12 the boundary is traced out by a straight line of 53,978 meters oriented in the south-west direction. The given coordinates of point No. 12 matches the river course of Rio Cononaco which has to be followed upstream to point No. 13. From here, by a straight line of 5,438 meters, the ZITT limit reach point No. 14 which overlaps the course of Rio Curaray. From this point the perimeter section follows the Curaray River upstream in the west direction until point No. 15. From point No. 15 to No. 16 the boundary is trace out by a straight line 10,190 meters long orientated in the north direction. It then heads north-east by another straight segment of 10,500 meters to reach point No. 17. From this point to that No. 1 the limit line close the perimeter by another straight line headed north.\nAccording to geographic interpretation of spatially explicit data contained in Art. 1 of the Decree 2187, the ZITT perimeter from point No. 7 to No. 17 does not show cartographic inconsistencies nor geomorphological ones.\n\n\nRio Dicaro and Rio Nashiño: the river basins analysis\nBasins and river dynamics analyses have been carried out to clarify the most critical perimeter section of the ZITT expressed between points No. 6 and No. 7.\nThe GIS analysis is based on comparing three different Digital Elevation Models (DEM) that clearly represent the terrain morphology: an IGM DEM map [77], an Aster GDEM (second version) map [78], and a SRTM map [79].\nThe DEM analysis of river basins spatial relationships clearly show the catchment's divides of the Rio Dicaro and the Rio Nashiño river basins. Using the results from three different DEM, maps demonstrate that it is not possible to operate a leap of basin to link out points No. 6 to that No. 7 (Figures 3, S3); however, according to the Decree 2187 text, it is clear that somewhere this leap has to be done.\nTherefore, “following downstream the Rio Dicaro till point No. 7 by the Rio Nashiño” (Art. 1, indent 3, Decree 2187) (Document S1) [15] becomes “geographical nonsense” in mapping out the perimeter section from points No. 6 to that No. 7. Due to this geographic ambiguity, different representations of the ZITT boundary in this area have been mapped out in official and unofficial cartography production on the Yasuní Biosphere Reserve [16]–[20].\n\n\nPerimeter section between points No. 7 and No. 8: a critical mapping out\nAccording to the Decree 2187 the ZITT boundary section between points No. 7 and No. 8 has to run exactly along the riverbed of the Rio Nashiño and consequently following the bottom valley line. On the contrary, the official cartographic representation of the ZITT boundary [17], [71], [80] seems to have mapped out a different limit line on the section close to point No. 7.\nTo validate this section of the limit by remote sensing technologies, a geospatial analysis has been developed using both DEM cartography (SRTM and GDEM maps) and satellite scenes (Landsat 5 TM) in order to deeply investigate the terrain morphology and the river dynamics in this area.\nTo deploy a crossed spatial analysis we have examined four Landsat 5 TM satellites scenes in the years 1990, 2004, 2005, and 2008. The DEM analysis of river dynamics clearly shows that the boundary section drifts away from the Rio Nashiño riverbed running over a hill's ridge (Figures 4, S4).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 4.

This mapping out violates both the terrain morphology and the same official text (Decree 2187, 2007).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0066293.g004The Rio Nashiño river course is consistent with all the analyzed time series satellite scenes. Despite the previous cartographic base used to trace out the ZITT limits, this boundary section does not match with results obtained by remote sensing analysis of Landsat 5 TM satellite imagery (Figures 5, S5), SRTM DEM, nor Aster GDEM. Following its own trace violates both the terrain morphology and the same official text (Decree 2187).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 5.

Moreover, geodata about the historic incidents between Tagaeri Taromenane and external actors has been included in the map.\nThe hydrographic network (unfortunately the map presents a spatial gap in the south-east sector of the Yasuní Biosphere Reserve due to the unavailability of data) has been included in the map background because sections of river are often used as a “natural boundary” to delimitate protected areas (Yasuní National Park, Waorani Ethnic Reserve and ZITT) and they also play a crucial role in the indigenous territory building [56], [81]–[83]. Furthermore, according to anthropological studies, we considered Tagaeri Taromenane as indigenous groups who traditionally establish their territory along “inter-fluvial” spaces [3], [65], [84].\nThe road network is represented by the complex of the Via Auca (at the west sector, built in 1972), Via Maxus (north-west sector, built in 1994), Via “Oxy” (built in 2003 by the Occidental Petroleum company), and the Via “Petrobras” (built in 2004 by the homonymous Brazilian oil company). All the roads in the Yasuní Biosphere Reserve are important terrestrial infrastructures for hydrocarbon reserves exploitation [38], [85], [86].\nAs it is shown in the synthesis map (Figure 6), presently the ZITT is geographically adjoined with productive oil concessions confirming the overlapping territorial policies. GIS analysis of spatial relationships between oil block areas and the Zona Intangible demonstrates that – except with blocks No. 16, No. 14 and No. 17 which seem to cut out the same ZITT perimeter – hydrocarbon concessions No. 31 (Petroamazonas) and the ITT block (managed by Secretaria de Hidrocarburos of Ecuador) result in, at the present time, an overlap of 8,542 and 9,952 ha (Figure 6; Table 1). It is relevant to clarify that the actual spatial dimension of oil blocks reflects the most recent changes operated by SHE in 2011 [87]. Before these relevant changes, previous GIS analysis had calculated a wider overlap of 84,789 ha by the overall oil blocks, corresponding to 10% of the ZITT. Areal overlap becomes greater if we consider the 10 km buffer zone of ZITT – 190,929 hectares, corresponding to 22,7% (Table 1) [20].\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 6.  Synthesis map: Yasuní National Park (YNP), Waorani Ethnic Reserve (WER), Zona Intangible Tagaeri Taromenane (ZITT) and oil blocks.The overlapping systems of territorial complexity in and around the Yasuní Biosphere Reserve: the Zona Intangible (ZITT) is geographically adjoined with productive oil concessions area at the north-west side; on the contrary the north-east sector overlaps both with oil blocks No. 31 (operated by the Petroamazonas national company) and that ITT block (Ishipingo-Tiputini-Tambococha block, Secreteria de Hidrocarburos of Ecuador). The spatial distribution of the Tagaeri Taromenane clans is partially outside the ZITT perimeter in the cases of the Nashiño and the Maxus groups; the Armadillo group is completely outside the ZITT boundary overlapping oil blocks No. 14 and No. 17. Their home range overlaps several titled and untitled land of mestizo (colonos) farmers and non-autochthonous indigenous settlements in the Dayuma and Ines Arango districts, implicating a sensible proximity with roads system related to the Via Auca main axis. The presence of the Armadillo group in this area is also confirmed by recent violent contacts between the Hormiguero oil platform and the Armadillo oil field.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0066293.g006\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 1.

As it is disclosed in the synthesis map, the ZITT area does not completely fit with the home range of Tagaeri Taromenane. The Cunchiyacu group is settled within the Curaray and Cononaco rivers within the ZITT. In the case of the Maxus and Nashino groups, the home range of these two clans is partially out of the ZITT area. On the contrary, the Tagaeri Taromenane Armadillo clan is definitely out of the same perimeter of the ZITT, completely overlapping oil blocks No. 14 and No. 17 (Figure 6) which are confirmed hydrocarbon reserve areas to be exploited by the Petrooriental oil company [89], [90].\nFurthermore, the Armadillo clan home range overlaps several titled and untitled lands of mestizo (colonos) farmers and non-autochthonous indigenous settlements in the Dayuma and Ines Arango districts, implicating a sensible proximity with roads system (Figures S1, S2) related to the Via Auca main axis [38].\nThe fact is a crucial zone in which different actors and different territory projects are at stake is also confirmed by the dramatic contacts between colonos and uncontacted people in 2009. Only 400 meters from the Hormiguero extraction platform (oil blocks No.17), a Tagaeri Taromenane group speared to death three local farmers [3], [27], [28], [91].\nThe Nashiño and the Maxus groups are partially outside the ZITT perimeter overlapping three oil blocks (No. 14, No. 17, No. 16, No. 31 and the ITT). In the case of the Maxus group most of their territory, having a home range of roughly 30 km, is outside the ZITT within the oil blocks No. 16 and No. 14. Within block No. 16 the news documented a possible contact in March 5th (2013) (under verification by Ecuadorian Authorities) confirming it is a critical area [29], [92], [93]. This spatial distribution of these clans is also confirmed by previous anthropological analysis on the Tagaeri Taromenane issue [2], [3], [28], [84], [94], in which several witnesses by the Waorani communities, settled within the same oil blocks No. 16, report the presence of uncontacted people in this precise area. Moreover, qualitative field based research by Colleoni and Proaño refer to signs of presence by footprints and typical symbolic territory demarcations (i.e. crossed broken branches) in the area of the Rio Dicaro sources, between oil blocks No. 14 and No. 17., identifying a mobility space of uncontacted people that are used to cross from Rio Dicaro to Rio Yasuní (Figure 6). This behaviour is also confirmed by the database of Ministerio de Justicia y derechos Humanos related to the operation derived from direct survey and patrols of the ZITT and surrounding areas.\nA synthesis map of the critical zone defined between points No. 5, 6, and 7 of the ZITT has been produced. Geospatial data on hydrocarbon concessions (10th licensing round), oil fields and wells, Waorani communities, and the home range of Tagaeri Taromenane have been assembled using a SRTM DEM map to also show geomorphological characteristics. This map shows spatial relationships between oil production areas, the ZITT perimeter, and the Maxus uncontacted group (Figure 7).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 7.

Spatial relationships between oil production areas and the Zona Intangible perimeter section are clearly shown in the map. The attack has major significance in terms of its location since it occurred near the geographic inconsistencies highlighted by this paper: about 100 meters from the Wipsi-1 oil platform, 10 km from point 7, almost 20 km from point 7, along the border of the Buffer Zone. Background raster map has been assembled using a SRTM DEM model to also show geomorphological characteristics of the area.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0066293.g007\n\nDrawing a new map: recognizing the spatial patterns of Tagaeri Taromenane\nFrom the perspective of the geography discipline, the territory is not just a polygon closed by a perimeter linking the adjoining areas. Territories are based on junctions, corridors, multiple and non-continuous polygons, centres and peripheries, intensity and directions of functions, multiple uses of natural resources, and co-existence of actors [56], [81], [82], [95]–[97]. As it as shown by the geographical analysis of the ZITT, every geometrical space may include multiple territories, often conflicting each other.\nIn a geographical perspective, territories are produced not only by physical intervention, but also (and before physical intervention) by images and particularly maps since they are the strongest way to produce imaginary geographies [98]–[102]. Normally maps presenting the ZITT are produced in the framework of the Westphalian territorial idea based on a rigid geometry of surface and perimeter which is the classical and most common representation of the ZITT. Figure 8 tries to produce a map representation closer to human right policies and the spatial patterns of Tagaeri Taromenane. First of all limits are abolished. Second, there is a representation of the buffer zone (normally not communicated). Third, a territorial continuity between the nuclei of the four groups and the official ZITT has been represented. This representation shows that the traditional geometric ZITT seems unable to contain the territory reconstructed from the traces of practical territorialization implemented by Tagaeri Taromenane. The decision to use a texture instead of a strong tick colour or an empty area with a marked perimeter is a typical choice from a wide array of tools available to cartographic science. Its usage stresses the communication message of a cultural geography of network relationships among societies and ecosystems [103]–[106].\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 8.  Synthesis map of the Zona Intangible. Recognizing the complex territory of uncontacted Tagaeri Taromenane: from geometry to geography.The map results from the combination of human right policies (Zona Intangible Tagaeri Taromenane) representing also the Buffer Zone (normally avoided in official maps), the oil concessions for hydrocarbon production and the spatial patterns of Tagaeri Taromenane (combining the results of data about paths and presences). Considering the power of images in shaping territorial representation, cartography science has the responsibility in formulating more complex discourses about controversial territories.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0066293.g008This map is only a first attempt to highlight how the recognition of indigenous territory in the Amazon basin needs to implement geographical approaches in order to deal with the complex dynamics of territories and territorialities in relation to actors and conflicts.\n\nMaterials and MethodsTo develop geographical analysis of the ZITT limits we primarily examined the Decrees No. 552 (1999) and No. 2187 (2007). The first one officially declares the No-Go-Zone as “an Intangible Zone for conservation of the homeland of the Waorani groups known as Tagaeri Taromenane in which it is forbidden in perpetuity whatever sort of extractive activities” (see the Spanish original text in supporting materials) while the second one determines the boundary of the ZITT providing geospatial information and detailed geomorphological description of the area [14], [15]. In the second Decree (2007) the ZITT is cartographically defined by 17 pairs of metrical coordinates conjoined to each other by straight lines or sections of river courses (Figure 1A). It also declares the Geographical System adopted to mark off the ZITT: Provisional South America Datum 1956 (PSAD-1956), 18 South Zone. The total area declared is 758,051 ha.\nIn order to validate the perimeter of the ZITT, we analyzed topographic sheets by the Military Geographic Institute of Ecuador (Instituto Geografico Militar, IGM) at different scales (1:50,000, 1:250,000). The IGM cartography at a 1:50,000 scale consists of four sheets named as Rio Bahameno [107], Rio Yasuní Este [108], Rio Nashiño [109], and Rio Yamino [110]. The sheets adjoin each other to form four quadrants including, in their common corner, the perimeter between points No. 5, No. 6, and No. 7. The sheets are provided of geographical metadata defining as projected into a UTM 18 South, Datum WGS 1984 except the Rio Nashiño map that is projected in the Zone 17 South. All four sheets have been assembled using aerial photography mainly taken in the year 1986 while the “Yasuní” sheet is derived by photographic coverage from 1963 and the “Rio Bahameno” sheet from 1976. Contour lines show an equidistance mainly of 20 meters and occasionally of 10 meters. These values are obtained by subtracting a constant of 30 meters of altitude assuming an average canopy of the MTF of 30 meters high.\nAltimetry points show a distribution average of 0.6 values per km2, calculated by three information aliquots of 66 km2. Geodetic and trigonometric points are rare most likely due difficulty of accessing to the Amazon territory.\nTo perform a comparative cartographic analysis we also used the 1:250,000 IGM sheets named Shushufindi [111] and Curaray [112]. Unfortunately, the Military Geographic Institute does not cover the eastern territory of the ZITT by the other two adjoining quadrants. However, the “Shushufindi” sheet represents a more detailed cartographic landscape compared to the ones at 1:50,000 scale. On the contrary, the Curaray sheet is definitely poor, without any basic metadata. These topographic sheets were produced in the year 1998 and are basically derived from the 1:50,000 scale sheets. Therefore, we do not expect different information according to the larger scale. In any case, both the 1:250,000 scale sheets represent a poor and incomplete hydrographic network. For instance, there are some river sources ending at the border of the sheet and not continuing onto the adjoining one.\nIn order to analyze the spatial relationships both of catchment's divides and hydrographic network related the ZITT perimeter we acquired raster thematic cartography (Table S2). Three types of Digital Elevation Models (DEM) maps have been used to deeply investigate both the terrain morphology and river dynamics [113]–[116]: an IGM-DEM map [117], a Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) map [79], and a GDEM derived by the Aster satellite [78].\nThe IGM-DEM map presents a geometric resolution of 30 meters (one spot elevation every 900 m2), the SRTM map of 92 meters (one spot elevation every 8,400 m2), and the GDM Aster satellite of 30 meters. The SRTM elevation spot derives directly by radar interferometry technique. On the contrary, the IGM-DEM map is obtained not by remote sensing technology, but by cartographic data included in maps at 1:50,000 and 1:250,000 scale.\nThe remote sensing data from the Aster satellite (GDEM) presents a higher geometric resolution to the ground – 30 instead of 90 meters – but they show several false records due to the intense land cover of the MTF. Therefore, these satellite derived maps present a repetitive error more extensive in the representation, but homogeneous and, consequently, tolerable.\nMoreover, Landsat satellite imagery has been used to validate some uncertain segments of the perimeter represented by river course sections. Three satellite time-series of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) false colour composite (4 blue, 5 green, 7 red) [118] of the territory encompassed between points No. 7 and No. 8 in the southern sector of the Oil Block 31 (PetroAmazonas) have been acquired. The Landsat satellite scenes acquired are from the years 1991 and 2005 (2nd of July and 28th of August respectively). For a complete overview of the raster cartography used in the spatial analysis see Table S1.\nOther geodata has been used to perform the spatial analysis of the ZITT perimeter together with other key components shaping the Yasuní territory in order to have a systemic understanding of the complex territorial processes taking place in the area [20], [96].\nGeospatial information on protected areas (Yasuní National Park, Waorani Ethnic Reserve), hydrographic network, and urban centres are from institutional web sources and were publicly available at the time of the submission. These include the World Database on Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC, IUCN World Commissions on Protected Areas, 2012) [119] and the EcuadorIan IGM Geoportal. The official ZITT perimeter and geographical data on Tagaeri Taromenane clans distribution have been acquired from the Ministerio de Justicia, Derechos Humanos y Cultos of Ecuador (2012), who from October 2010 holds the Plan of Precautionary Measures for the Protection of Isolated Indigenous Peoples of Ecuador (Plan de Medidas Cautelares, PMC) [88].\nRoad network of Ecuadorian Amazon was taken by the Instituto Nacional para el Eco-Desarrollo de la Region Amazonica Ecuatoriana (ECORAE) in 2008 [120].\nOil fields and oil wells have been acquired by the ECORAE institution (2008). Oil blocks with the latest changes (2011) of the 10th hydrocarbon licensing round have been derived by digitizing oil maps released in 2012 by the Secreteria de Hidrocarburos Ecuatorianos (SHE) [87]. An overview of characteristics of all vector geodata used in the spatial analysis are shown in Table S3.\nThe main tools to conduct cartographic and spatial analysis of the ZITT have been Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing technologies. GIScience approach has been used to collect and elaborate different types of data, as long as spatially explicit, referring both to the biophysical components and to the anthropic one, so that cartographic outputs and synthesis maps make visible spatial relationships between relevant components of environmental systems and that of the anthropic one [121]–[124].\nAll the anthropic, physical, and geographical data collected have been integrated in a GIS database in order to manage spatially explicit, temporally referenced, and thematically differentiated information.\nSpatial analyses are based both on a critical examination and integration of the physical and thematic cartography previously acquired and on GIS elaboration in order to produce analytical and synthesis maps showing the following data: hydrographic network, river basins, protected areas (Yasuní National Park, Waorani Ethnic Reserve, ZITT) and buffer zones, urban centres and local communities, road network, and the spatial dimension of the hydrocarbon exploitation (blocks, oil fields and wells). Moreover, we have also acquired spatial anthropological data concerning the Tagaeri Taromenane as the family clans spatial distribution [88].\nArcGISTM 10.1 software has been used for GIS analysis mainly conducted by spatial functions such as overlay, geometrical interception, linear, and area measurements. Raster data analysis has been carried out using IDRISI-GIS software.\nTo validate important data such as spatial information of key rivers, local communities and roads the GPS ground-truth methodology has been adopted during fieldwork activities (2005, 2006, 2010, 2011) [38] [125].\nResults of GIS and remote sensing analysis, fieldwork data, and examination of all the available sources show different critical issues in the Decree 2187 when it comes to defining the perimeter of the ZITT. They belong both at an interpretation level and, therefore, in the same cartographic representations. On the other side, the policies implemented in the ZITT and in the Buffer Zone show conflicting territorial objectives.During the revision of this article, in the night between the 4th and 5th of March 2013, the old Waorani man Ompore and his wife Buganey were speared to death in proximity of Iro oil field, in Block 16, which is operated by Repsol-YPF (Figure 6, 7). The attack should be confirmed, and at the moment investigation into the incident has been initiated by police and Ecuadorian authorities to ascertain the responsibility of Tagaeri Taromenane groups. Information collected by Waorani relatives of Ompore Omeway and Buganey Cayga refer to repetitive requests by Tagaeri Taromenane directed to Ompore to act with the oil company to stop oil extraction, pollution of water and air, and noise [92], [93], [126]. Meanwhile, a group of Waorani from the Yarentaro community organized an expedition to avenge their dead relatives, entered the ZITT, and killed approximately dozens of Tagaeri Taromenane as well as abducted two uncontacted youths. This fact, confirmed by an official twitter account of Ministerio de Justicia on the 3rd of April 2013, is also under investigation.These two dramatic events should be deeply analyzed in order to understand the complex relationship among uncontacted Waorani groups and the wide group of Waorani, the discontinued presence of the State, the role of Waorani organizations, and the deterministic approach of some NGO advisors.The incident of 5th of March also demonstrates the long and complex process to enact human right policies in a controversial and complex territory. Moreover, the attack has major significance in terms of its location since it occurred near the geographic inconsistencies highlighted by this paper: about 100 meters from the Wipsi-1 oil platform, 10 km from point 7, almost 20 km from point 7, along the border of the Buffer Zone (Figure 7).So it is interesting to analyze how the limit line of the ZITT runs when it moves – close to point No. 6, from west to east direction – within this zone inward the oil block 16 (Repsol-YPF): after a sudden curve upper slope it drastically runs to south leaving the oil blocks by the Nashiño river, setting up a kind of cartographic enclave by a “bird beak” shape (Figure 7). After considering previous anthropological studies on Tagaeri and Taromenane in this area, one can logically ask the question: is the ZITT boundary line between the Dicaro and Nashiño rivers shaping an ethnical enclave as well?Using a systemic approach to better define this issue, it is relevant to also take into account the geographical position and the same history of the ZITT (Figure 6).During three years of the delimitation process (2004–2007), the Technical Commissions established by the Environment Ministry of Ecuador had to deal with blocks for oil exploitation which extensively overlap the northwest sector of the ZITT (Figure 6). This is the case of oil block No. 14 and No. 17 (Andes-Petroleum Company, China) which presented an overlap of 2,719 and 24,534 ha, respectively, in the same area of the ZITT, namely 1.4% and the 49.6% of each oil concession (Table 1) [64].Due to a possible and relevant reduction of oil block areas during the ZITT delimitation process, the Andes-Petroleum company suggested to the Ministry of Energy (Ministerio de Energia y Minas) and its Environmental Department (DINAPA) to modify the perimeter in order to facilitate oil exploitation in the area maintaining direct access to the proved oil field called Awant-1. Previous GIS analysis [20] showed the “cartographic suggestion” of Andes Petroleum to create – according to its productive requirements – a special corridor to exploit the Awant-1 oil field (Fig. S6) which is localized 12,8 km to south point No. 6, inside the same ZITT area (Figure 7).All of these geographical elements display the complexity of the Yasuní Biosphere Reserve in which different projects of territory – and, therefore, different modalities to use natural resources – are overlapped and often in conflict each other. A geography of energetic resources marked in maps by productive zoning (oil blocks) is superposed to that of protected areas (Yasuní National Park), to that of farmers settlements (Agrarian Reform), to that of indigenous territory (Waorani Ethnic Reserve), and finally to that of the ZITT [38], [51], [56].The same delimitation of the ZITT induced a national and international debate on uncontacted people and their territorial rights. Aguirre (2007) stresses that since first steps of delimitation (2004) the process has been sinuous and thorny, made by consultation and negotiations, in primis with oil companies operating in the area of the ZITT. Later with officers of United Nation and IUCN, with the Waorani indigenous Organization (NAWE) and the National Indigenous Confederation of Ecuador (CONAIE), and finally national and international NGOs, without avoiding the weak but existing pressures from the local colonos (settled farmers of agrarian reform).In general, beyond the technical issue to map out a perimeter for the ZITT, anthropological studies argue that a lack of understanding of territory and the same territoriality of the Tagaeri Taromenane is one of the main factors of the weakness in delimitating an Zona Intangible [2], [3], [6], [25], [41].It is not just a technical issue considering the geographical and the biophysical characteristics of an area placed in the core of the Amazon region. It is a remote zone in which the Moist Tropical Forest as well as the dense and homogeneous hydrographic network, both set up a territory that is difficult to study, understand, and control. Therefore, mapping out the boundaries by “remote” analyses, using unverified geospatial data and not considering the complex arena in which territorial dynamics and the same territoriality of the Tagaeri Taromenane take place, is very difficult without holistic approaches and knowledge based on fieldwork.Moreover, if we consider that the Decree 2187 uses “natural boundaries”, such as section of rivers, to delimit the ZITT perimeter, cartographic operations become more complicated, especially if the geospatial data is not precise, they present data gaps, or relevant geographic errors.On the other side, a ZITT perimeter only based on straight lines could be easily traced out. However, in tropical forest territory, whatever border marked out that does not have clear natural spatial references, such as rivers or hills, results in a concealed boundary. A ZITT cartographically perfect will be produced, but at the same time it is invisible on the ground to both residents and to the people “from outside”.A scientific contribution in the ZITT debate is necessary to make visible this territory (physically and graphically) to different components of Ecuadorian society because the ultimate objective of this policy is the right to liveable place of Tagaeri Taromenane uncontacted people.In a structural context where media debate about the Amazon as “space of exception” [100], and ZITT territoriality is disputed, it is important to remember what “The protection guidelines for indigenous peoples in isolation” issued in May 2012 by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR, 2012) states: “While there is no consensus on the term to be used to refer to these people, internationally the most widely used is the concept of \"isolated peoples”, in some countries they are known as, inter alia, free people, uncontacted, hidden, invisible, in voluntary isolation. Despite the different formulations, all refer to the same concept “isolation was not a voluntary option but a survival strategy (par. 9)”."

            "fulltext": "IntroductionBillions of people move everyday from home to workplace and generate networks of socio-economic relationships that are the vector of social and economic dynamics such as epidemic outbreaks, information flows, city development and traffic [1], [3]. Understanding the essential properties of these networks and reproducing them accurately is therefore a crucial issue for public health institutions, policy makers, urban development, infrastructure planners, etc. [4], [5]. This challenge is the subject of an intensive scientific activity (see [6], [7] for reviews), in which the analogy of the gravitational attraction inspires a majority of approaches [8], [9]: the number of commuters between two geographic units (cities, counties, regions…) is supposed proportional to the product of the \"masses\" of each geographic unit (the population for example) and inversely proportional to a function of the distance between them. Unfortunately, numerous experiments showed that the optimum function and parameter values vary a lot with the case studies [4], [5], [10], [11]. This situation is not satisfactory because when one wants to generate a particular commuting network without having the total origin destination matrix of commuting, no practical heuristic is available for choosing the adequate type of function and parameter values. This paper addresses this problem.\nWe consider a recently proposed model [12], [13], differentiating itself from the usual gravity law models in two main features:\n\n\n\n\nIt takes as input the total number of commuters in and out from each geographic unit. With this starting point, the model focuses directly on the influence of the distance between geographic units on the commuting probability. The model is data demanding, but these data are widely available.\n\nIt builds the network progressively, allocating commuters one by one in the different flows, according to probabilities that increase with the number of commuters coming in the destination and decrease with the distance between the origin and destination. These probabilities are updated after each allocation.\n\nOur model is close to the traditional doubly-constrained gravity model [8], [9], but it is more flexible and less data demanding. Indeed, the doubly constrained model and the methods used to solve it require a closed network of commuters: they cannot take into account commuting links outside the considered geographical units. Our individual based stochastic approach overcomes this problem and can deal with the usually available data of total number of commuters in and out of geographic units.\nWe test this model on 80 case-studies with geographic units of different scales. For example in the same case-study the geographic unit can be either the municipality, the canton or the department, (see an example on Figure 1). More precisely, the case studies include: Czech Republic (municipality scale, 1 case-study), France (municipality scale, 34 case-studies), France (canton scale, 15 case-studies including whole France), France (département scale one case-study (whole France), Italy (municipality scale, 10 case-studies), Italy (province scale, 4 case-studies), USA (county level, 15 case-studies including whole USA).

Three scales of geographic units (Auvergne region, France).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0045985.g001We show that the single parameter of our model follows a simple universal law that depends only on the average surface of the considered geographic units. This implies that, given the number of commuters in and out of each geographic unit and their average surface, we can derive the whole matrix of flows with a very good confidence.\nTwo other approaches [1], [2] claim to catch universal properties of commuting networks. We show that our model yields significantly more accurate results, especially for case-studies with small geographic units (e.g. municipalities).\nThe ModelWe consider the basic double-constrained model setup, without adding any ingredient about the job market characteristics (professions, salary range, etc.). Instead of solving analytically the optimisation problem, we use an individual based procedure that allocates virtual individuals one by one in the different flows between geographic units, according to a probability that is updated after each allocation.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 2.

In other words the doubly contrained model can only deal with the flows between the considered geographic units; it cannot take into account the commuting links with destinations outside the case study area. This is a problem when only the numbers of commuters in and out the geographic units are available (and not the complete matrix of the commuting flows), because the data do not distinguish between the flows inside and outside the case study area. It is therefore difficult to estimate the correct data to take as input to the doubly-constrained model in this case. Our approach is more flexible and overcomes this difficulty. It does not require that the total number of commuters in and out to be equal (for more details see [13]), hence it can easily use directly the usually available data on the number of commuters in and out of each geographic unit.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 3.

We chose a probability decreasing exponentially with the distance, in accordance with the investigations carried out in [13] and with the literature on commuting network models. The importance of the distance in the commuting choices is embedded in parameter : for  the probability tends to be independent from the distance, while for high values of , the probability tends to zero very rapidly when the distance increases, independently from the number of commuters arriving in the units.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 4.

We show that this parameter can be derived as a function of the scale of the problem, independently from the socio-geographical location of the case study area. This opens the possibility to reconstruct the commuting flows (origin-destination matrix) when they are not provided.\nWe calibrated parameter  by maximising the common part of commuters (CPC), based on the Sørensen index [14].(2)with:(3)where  is the observed origin-destination matrix and  is the simulated one. This is a similarity measure based on the Sørensen index in ecology computing which part of the commuting flows is correctly reproduced, on average, by the simulated network. It varies between 0, when no agreement is found, and 1, when the two networks are identical. We priviledged this indicator because of its direct interpretation. Indeed, when  (it is the case for our model), the CPC represents the percentage of commuting connection correctly located (i.e. with the right pair origin - destination). Moreover, we tested on all case studies that the results obtained with the MAE, the RMSE or CPC are equivalent (see the Supporting Information   for more details). We have also shown in [12], [13] that the value of  yielding the maximum CPC also yields the maximum similarity between observed and simulated commuting distance distributions. As an example on the  case study, Figure 2 shows that the same  value maximizes the CPC and minimizes the MAE. In this Figure we can also note that the CPC is very sensitive to  and that its value does not vary much with the different replicas of the stochastic solving process.\nMoreover, in order to have an idea of the improvement of the model compared with complete randomness, we have computed the CPC of a random model where the probabilities presented in Equation (1) are uniform (, where  is the number of units). As shown on the Figure 3 we obtained an average CPC around 0.1. For our model, the CPC is always higher than 0.7 with an average around 0.8, which can be interpreted as 70 to 80% of correctly predicted commuting connections.\nOur goal is to derive the value of  from some easily available global characteristics of the case-study, giving the possibility to reconstruct the commuting flows when they are not available. Figure 4 gives strong evidence of such a universal relation.\nThe x-axis represents the average surface of the geographic units of the case-study ( in logarithm scale) and the y-axis the optimal  value (in logarithm scale). The linear regression in the log-log plane shows a simple relation:(4)with  and .  corresponds to the  value for the unitary surface 1 . The high value of the adjusted  confirms the quality of the linear model. We observe that  decreases with the average surface of the units , meaning that, when  is small (e.g. for municipalities in France) the distance is more important in the commuting choice than when  is large (e.g. for regions or counties).\nWe now evaluate the robustness of our estimation of  and  using a common statistical procedure: the cross-validation. The cross-validation aims at evaluating the potential error of using the  value derived from the regression model intsead of deriving this value by optimisation for a new case study. This procedure repeats a large number of times the following steps: define a sub-sample of the total sample of case studies, derive a regression model of  from this sub-sample, for each case study that do not belong to the sub-sample, derive  from this regression model and compare the corresponding CPC with the value of  directly calibrated on the complete origin - destination data. The dataset (including 80 case-studies) is randomly cut into two sets, called the training set (comprising 53 case-studies) and the test set (composed of 27 case-studies). We build a regression model on the training set, providing  and , from which we derive estimates of  for each of the 27 case-studies of the testing set. We have 27 estimations of  using the relation 4 where  and  are obtained from the random sub-sample of 53 case-studies. We repeat this process  times obtaining 270,000 estimations of  (uniformly distributed over the 80 case-studies) corresponding to about  estimations of  for each case study. Then we calculate the average, minimum and maximum CPC for each of these values of , and we compare them with the CPC obtained with value of  directly calibrated on the data.\nFigure 3 shows, for each case-study, the CPC associated with the calibrated , the average CPC obtained with the  values estimated from the cross-validation and the confidence interval defined by the minimum and the maximum values (but it is too small to be seen in most cases). The CPC obtained with the calibrated  value (black triangle) is almost the same as the average CPC obtained with the estimated  in most cases (red square). Globally, we can conclude that the  estimated with the log-linear model and the calibrated  lead to very similar CPCs and also very similar MAE and the RMSE as shown in the appendix  . The method appears therefore fairly robust and this gives confidence for using it with the value of  derived from our loglog regression in new cases studies.\n\n\n3.2 Comparaison with Other Universal Derivations of Commuting Networks\nTwo other different approaches, [1] and [2], claim also to provide a universal derivation of commuting networks. The objective of [1] is to generate a worldwide commuting network, and the model must deal with the wide variety of populations and surfaces of geographic units for which the data are available. To solve this difficulty, the authors project these data on ad-hoc units defined with a Voronoi diagram. They define their basic unit as a cell approximately equivalent to a rectangle of 25×25 kilometers along the Equator. This allows them to calibrate their model because a unit is the same object whatever the country. This is an interesting solution for generating a world-wide commuting network but it leads to an average commuting distance of 250 km which is much larger than the average distance of daily commuting. For example for the USA case study the average distance of daily commuting is about 68 km for the observed network and about 64 km for the simulated network obtained with our algorithm. For the Auvergne (France) case study at municipality scale the average distance of daily commuting is about 12 km for the observed network and about 11 km for the simulated one.\nIn the radiation model, proposed in [2], the commuting flow between two geographic units is a function of the cumulated population in a circle at the distance between the two units. The model has an elegant analytical solution and the average flow  from unit  to unit  can be approximated by(5)where  and  are respectively the population of units  and ,  is the total number of commuters and  is the total population in the case-study region, and  the total population in the circle of radius  centred at  (excluding the source and destination population).\nWe implemented their analytical approximation and reproduced the graphs presented in their paper. Figure 5 shows the comparison between the radiation model and ours in the US for inter-county commuting and in the French Auvergne region for inter-municipality commuting (see the Supporting Information for more examples). We observe that in both cases our approach yields significantly better results. Moreover, as shown on Figure 3, the average CPC for the radiation model on all the case studies is around 0.4, and lower for all case studies than the one obtained with our approach.\nHowever, it should be reminded that our model uses more specific data (total number of commuters in and out of each geographic unit) than the radiation model, hence one could expect our results to be more accurate. Therefore, to be fair with the radiation model we implemented a modified version of this model using the number of out and in commuters of each units. This new approximation is presented in Equation 6 where  the total number of in-commuters in the circle of radius  centred at  (excluding the source and destination).(6)\nAs shown on Figure 3, this new model reaches an average CPC around 0.5 which is higher than the original radiation model but still significantly lower than the results obtained with our model. Using the MAE and the RMSE leads to the same conclusions (see the appendix   for more details).\n\nThe power law of our model’s single parameter  with the average area of the case study geographic units, is surprising to us because of the high variety in our case studies in terms of scale, number of units, number of commuters and surface areas. For instance the Auvergne region in France is rural with a population density of about 50 hab./km whereas the New York City region is very urban with a population density of about 6500 hab./km. As far as we know, this is the first time that a single model is shown to fit such diverse group of datasets.We show that our approach outperforms the radiation model and that the difference of input data plays a minor role in this superiority. This superiority is not due to our particular treatment of the border effects either. Indeed, we could check our approach outperforms the radiation model also on particular case studies (e.g. on islands such as Corsica) where this border effect does not play. We can conclude that the accuracy of our model comes from a proper use of the number of commuters in and out of each geographic unit and an adequate choice of the function of the distance.The results of the cross validation procedure give a good confidence in the robustness of this law. However, we have to admit that, despite their diversity, our 80 case studies come all from western industrialised countries. Therefore it will be important to check the validity of our law on case studies coming from other continents and less industrialised countries. Moreover, we use a very rough approximation of the distance between the geographic units with the Euclidian distance between the unit centroids. More accurate approximations of this distance would certainly improve the results. Finally, we also intend to apply our approach to commuting networks inside urban areas because many cities of the world show an impressive growth and an increasing part of commuting takes place within them [15]. An important issue in our perspective is to check if our law holds at this scale."

                "\n        Large-scale patterns of spatial variation in species geographic range size are central to many fundamental questions in macroecology and conservation biology. However, the global nature of these patterns has remained contentious, since previous studies have been geographically restricted and/or based on small taxonomic groups. Here, using a database on the breeding distributions of birds, we report the first (to our knowledge) global maps of variation in species range sizes for an entire taxonomic class. We show that range area does not follow a simple latitudinal pattern. Instead, the smallest range areas are attained on islands, in mountainous areas, and largely in the southern hemisphere. In contrast, bird species richness peaks around the equator, and towards higher latitudes. Despite these profoundly different latitudinal patterns, spatially explicit models reveal a weak tendency for areas with high species richness to house species with significantly smaller median range area. Taken together, these results show that for birds many spatial patterns in range size described in geographically restricted analyses do not reflect global rules. It remains to be discovered whether global patterns in geographic range size are best interpreted in terms of geographical variation in species assemblage packing, or in the rates of speciation, extinction, and dispersal that ultimately underlie biodiversity.\n      \n        The first global maps of variation in species range sizes for an entire taxonomic class--birds--reveals that range area does not follow a simple latitudinal pattern.\n      "

            "fulltext": "IntroductionLarge-scale patterns of spatial variation in species geographic range size are central to many fundamental questions in macroecology and conservation biology. These include such issues as the origin and maintenance of diversity, the potential impacts of environmental change, and the prioritisation of areas for conservation [1–6]. However, the form taken by these patterns in geographic range size has remained surprisingly contentious.    \nInterest has focused foremost on the relationship between geographic range size and latitude, whose existence appears first to have been suggested by Lutz [7]. Rapoport [1] drew further attention to a tendency for range sizes to decline from high to low latitudes, and this was subsequently formalised as “Rapoport's rule” [2]. The generality of the rule has been much debated. A number of studies have argued that there is empirical evidence for the pattern [2,\n\t\t\t\t8–15], others that empirical evidence is lacking or is very weak [16–25]. Whilst some have argued that the pattern lacks sufficient generality to be termed a “rule” [5,\n\t\t\t\t17,\n\t\t\t\t20,\n\t\t\t\t24–26], others have treated the pattern as if it were a general one or have regarded the issue as unresolved [3,\n\t\t\t\t11,\n\t\t\t\t21,\n\t\t\t\t27–31].\n\t\t\t\nLatitudinal gradients in geographic range size have received such attention largely because of their possible implications for the mechanisms underlying spatial variation in species richness, and particularly the tendency for richness to be much greater in the tropics. Indeed, Stevens [2] argued that there may be a connection between the two. Temperate species may have larger geographic range sizes than tropical species, due to their tolerance of a broader range of environmental conditions, necessitated by greater variance in such conditions at individual sites. This could then promote higher levels of species coexistence in the tropics through a “mass effect” [32], whereby some of the occurrence of species is maintained by immigration of individuals into communities outside their restricted microhabitats.    \nMost tests for a relationship between spatial variation in species richness and geographic range size have been indirect, and based on the existence or otherwise of a latitudinal gradient in the latter. Yet, species numbers do not just vary with distance from the equator [33], as the recently published first map of global avian species richness clearly demonstrates [34]. Hotspots of bird species richness coincide with tropical mountain ranges, and richness declines away from these areas in all compass directions. If species richness and geographic range size are causally linked, then we would expect spatial variation in geographic range size to be equally richly textured. Yet, direct tests of such a relationship remain scarce, with some studies supporting a link [15,\n\t\t\t\t35,\n\t\t\t\t36] and others refuting it [6,\n\t\t\t\t14,\n\t\t\t\t18,\n\t\t\t\t37].\n\t\t\t\nSignificantly, the majority of analyses to date of relationships both between geographic range size and latitude, and between range size and species richness, have been conducted within individual biogeographic realms. It has repeatedly been observed that the outcomes may depend on which realm or smaller biogeographic unit is being considered [17,\n\t\t\t\t20,\n\t\t\t\t22,\n\t\t\t\t23,\n\t\t\t\t25,\n\t\t\t\t38]. In particular, studies that find evidence for the existence of Rapoport's rule are largely restricted to the Nearctic [5,\n\t\t\t\t20], leading to the suggestion that it may be a local phenomenon that does not generalise [17]. Moreover, limiting analyses to individual biogeographic realms almost invariably means that species whose geographic ranges extend beyond those realms are ignored, or their ranges truncated to the limits of the realms [5]. The consequences for results are unknown, but may be marked where a sizeable proportion of species are distributed across multiple biogeographic realms.    \nWhat has been almost entirely missing from discussion of spatial variation in geographic range sizes has been a global perspective for major taxa. All previous studies suffer from concerns about the generality of patterns from limited numbers of biogeographic realms, and hence fail to resolve uncertainty about the true nature of spatial variation in geographic range sizes. Here, we present the first global-scale analysis of spatial variation in the geographic range sizes of species for a major taxon, all extant species of birds. We use a global database of avian distributions, mapped on an equal area projection at a scale similar to a 1° grid, to derive estimates of range sizes as the geographic breeding range area of bird species (excluding primarily marine species; see      Materials and Methods). Global patterns of bird species richness were previously determined using this database [34], which allows us to explore in detail both spatial variation in geographic range size and its link to species richness, using data of unparalleled geographic extent and resolution.    \nResults\nSpecies-Range Area Distributions\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFigure 1 summarizes the global species-range area distribution for birds. The distribution is strongly right-skewed (Figure 1A), with the mean range area (2.82 × 106 km2) of the 9,505 extant species markedly larger than the median (0.87 × 106 km2). More than a quarter (27.6%) of bird species have geographic range areas smaller than 225,000 km2, less than the area of Great Britain or Minnesota. The species-range area distribution is formally neither lognormal (Figure 1B; D = 0.0656, \n\t\t\t\t\tp ≪ 0.001) nor logit-normal (D = 0.0636,       p ≪ 0.001), with strong left-skew in both cases. Normal probability plots reveal that the geographic range areas of the more restricted and the more widespread species are small relative to expectation (Figure 1C).\n\t\t\t\t\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.

The median geographic range area of the species coexisting in each grid cell shows strong spatial patterns (Figure 2A). The smallest median range areas occur on islands, in low-latitude mountainous areas, and to a large extent in the southern hemisphere (Figure 2A), as are the smallest range areas overall (the range area of the most narrowly distributed species in each grid cell;       Figure 2B). The variance in range area is typically higher in the northern hemisphere, especially in mid-latitudes (Figure 2C). Some previous analyses of spatial variation in geographic ranges have focused on the latitudinal extent of the distributions of species. The median latitudinal extent of the bird species coexisting in each grid cell shows a rather different, but equally complex, picture to that for range area (Figure 2D). The main differences lie in the higher Afrotropical and lower Palearctic latitudinal extents compared to the patterns of range area, however there are similarities in the distribution of the smallest median extents, notably in mountainous regions and some island groups. The spatial distribution of the smallest latitudinal extents (the range extent of the most narrowly distributed species in each grid cell;       Figure 2E) is very similar to that of the smallest range areas (Figure 2B).\n\t\t\t\t\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 2.

Contrary to the predictions of Rapoport's Rule, geographic range area does not decline towards the tropics in both hemispheres (Figure 2A, \n\t\t\t\t\tTable 1). Rather, median range area is greatest at high, albeit not the highest, northern latitudes and decreases toward high southern latitudes. This relationship shows a subtle change in the magnitude of the slope at the equator, but does not show the change in sign that Rapoport's rule would predict (Figure 3A; scoring southern latitudes as negative, range size versus latitude across all cells:       r = 0.60, \n\t\t\t\t\tn = 17,867, \n\t\t\t\t\tp ≪ 0.001; for cell averages per latitudinal band:       r = 0.89, \n\t\t\t\t\tn = 151, \n\t\t\t\t\tp ≪ 0.001). There is no relationship between median range area and absolute latitude (i.e. regardless of hemisphere), once the sample size dominance of the northern hemisphere has been removed by averaging within latitudinal bands (across all cells:       r = 0.45, \n\t\t\t\t\tn = 17,867, \n\t\t\t\t\tp ≪ 0.001; cell averages per latitudinal band:       r = 0.07, \n\t\t\t\t\tn = 151, \n\t\t\t\t\tp = 0.40).\n\t\t\t\t\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 3.

Global and Within-Realm Patterns in Range Size\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0040208.t001Within individual biogeographic realms and hemispheres, median range areas increase with latitude in only seven out of 13 cases, and six out of these seven are in the northern hemisphere (Table 1; see \n\t\t\t\t\tProtocol S2 for tests using all cells). In contrast, species richness shows strong latitudinal correlations with highest richness in tropical regions, and notable peaks in the Andes, Himalayas and African Rift Valley (Figure 2F; richness [square root transformed] versus latitude across all cells: southern hemisphere       r = −0.56, \n\t\t\t\t\tn = 4,903, \n\t\t\t\t\tp ≪ 0.001, northern hemisphere \n\t\t\t\t\tr = −0.39, \n\t\t\t\t\tn = 12,964, \n\t\t\t\t\tp ≪ 0.001; richness versus latitude for cell averages per latitudinal band: southern hemisphere       r = −0.98, \n\t\t\t\t\tn = 75, \n\t\t\t\t\tp ≪ 0.001, northern hemisphere \n\t\t\t\t\tr = −0.77, \n\t\t\t\t\tn = 76, \n\t\t\t\t\tp ≪ 0.001). In addition, the southern hemisphere shows both higher diversity at mid-low latitudes and a steeper decline with increasing latitude than the northern hemisphere (Figure 3B). These analyses are not sensitive either to the omission of island cells or to more conservative tests using differences in latitudinal values that account for latitudinal autocorrelation (see       Protocol S2).\n\t\t\t\t\nThe relationship between geographic range area and latitude is not an artefact of the way that geographic range size variation was quantified. Because analyses based on the range size characteristics of species in cells can be biased by shared species composition, we also checked the relationship using the “midpoint method” [16]. In this method, species are allocated to latitudinal bins based on the location of the latitudinal mid-points of their geographic ranges, so each species only contributes to one data point, and the median range area of the species in each bin is plotted against the latitude of that bin (Figure 3C). Globally, these data show an increase in median geographic range area from southern to northern latitudes (      r = 0.58, \n\t\t\t\t\tn = 126, \n\t\t\t\t\tp ≪ 0.001) and the decline in range areas at high northern latitudes is more marked using the midpoint method. Within hemispheres, there is no global trend in southern latitudes and a strong increase in northern latitudes; within hemispheres and realms, median geographic range areas increase significantly with latitude in only three out of 13 cases (see       Protocol S2). Although phylogenetic autocorrelation could influence these findings, evidence suggests that species range area shows low phylogenetic dependence (see       Protocol S2; [5,\n\t\t\t\t\t39]) and thus such autocorrelation will have a weak effect.     \nThe latitudinal gradient in land area across all latitudes (Figure 3D) is strongly correlated with median range area (Figure 3A, \n\t\t\t\t\tr = 0.72, \n\t\t\t\t\tn = 152, \n\t\t\t\t\tp ≪ 0.0001), particularly if the sharp decline in both variables above 67° N is omitted (      r = 0.95, \n\t\t\t\t\tn = 146, \n\t\t\t\t\tp ≪ 0.0001). One possible explanation of the patterns in range area is thus that the latitudinal extents of ranges (Figure 2D) increase from low to high latitudes but that the longitudinal constraints on range area mask this relationship. However, the latitudinal gradient in species latitudinal range extents (Figure 3E) shows weaker support for Rapoport's rule than does that in range area. Globally, latitudinal extent decreases, rather than increases, from low to high latitudes in both hemispheres (Table 1). Within individual biogeographic realms and hemispheres, latitudinal extent increases with latitude in only six out of 13 cases (Table 1). Indeed, in the northern hemisphere, increases in land area seem to mask decreases in latitudinal extent at higher latitudes.     \n\n\nRange Area and Species Richness\nSimple correlations between median geographic range area and species richness (Figure 3F) yield significant negative relationships globally and positive relationships in three out of eight biogeographic realms (Table 1). A more consistent picture is revealed once the similarity of proximal cells arising from spatial autocorrelation is explicitly modelled. This method shows that at a global scale median range area and species richness are negatively related (Table 1). Also, when individual biogeographic realms are considered separately, there is a negative relationship between range area and species richness in seven of the eight realms, with the only positive relationship being statistically non-significant (Table 1).\n\t\t\t\t\n\nDiscussionThe global species-range area distribution is strongly right-skewed, with the majority of species having small, but not the smallest, geographic ranges (Figure 1). This is consistent with previous studies, both of birds and other taxa, within biogeographic realms [5,\n\t\t\t\t6,\n\t\t\t\t40–43]. The departure from a log-normal and a logit-normal distribution, the two null models that have previously been suggested, is also consistent with the findings of such studies [5,\n\t\t\t\t43]. Such departures are typically interpreted as resulting from a lack or an excess of rare species relative to expectation [6,\n\t\t\t\t44,\n\t\t\t\t45]; normal probability plots (Figure 1C) show that here both for the log-normal and a logit-normal the range areas of the more widespread species are also small relative to expectation. This is likely to be a consequence of dispersal limitation of species to a subset of the major land masses as even the most widespread species are not cosmopolitan.    \nOverall, there is no global tendency for avian geographic range sizes to decline in area, or in latitudinal extent, towards the tropics (Figures 2A, \n\t\t\t\t2D). Rather, there is a general trend of declining median range area from high northern latitudes to high southern ones (Figure 3A). This leads to entirely different relationships between range area and latitude in different biogeographic realms, with those in the northern hemisphere typically conforming to Rapoport's rule, and those in the southern hemisphere failing to do so (Table 1). This both confirms that Rapoport's rule does not generalise [17,\n\t\t\t\t20,\n\t\t\t\t46], and cautions against assuming that biological patterns from the relatively well-studied northern temperate regions will apply to the rest of the world [47]. Current evidence suggests that Rapoport's rule in other taxa is limited principally to the same regions as for birds [20]. Nevertheless, we have shown here that a global perspective is needed truly to understand spatial variation in geographic range sizes, as conclusions based on single/limited biogeographical data may not be informative of overall pattern. It will be interesting to test the wider generality of the relationships shown for birds, as data for other taxa become available.    \nDescription of variation in avian geographic range areas in terms of latitude alone masks substantial spatial patterning, especially at low latitudes and in southern regions (Figure 2A). Small range areas are associated, perhaps unsurprisingly, with islands, but also with mountain ranges in the tropics and sub-tropics. This suggests that range areas may be constrained by the availability of land area within the climatic zones to which species are best adapted [48]. Thus, in South America, for example, the relatively climatically uniform expanse of the tropical lowland Amazon basin allows broad geographic ranges in species evolving within this region, in contrast to the restricted ranges available to species evolving to exploit any of the restricted climatic zones that pertain at different altitudes in the tropical Andes. This idea is also consistent with the global decline in median geographic range areas from high northern to high southern latitudes being generated by the availability of land area in different climatic zones. The overall decline corresponds well with the latitudinal pattern of land area (Figure 3D). Additionally, regions with particularly small median range area correspond well with regions where the proportion of land area contributed by islands is high (Figure 3H), although this latter pattern is not sufficient of itself to generate the latitudinal gradient in range area (see      Protocol S2).\n\t\t\t\nThe evident contrast between the global decline in median range area from high northern to high southern latitudes and the equatorial peak in species richness argues against any simple relationship between geographic range area and species richness (Figure 3F; or between latitudinal range extent and species richness:      Figure 3G). However, whilst the complexities of the patterns of spatial variation in both variables mean that using non-spatial models may be problematic, there is nonetheless a significant (albeit weak) negative global relationship between the two (Table 1). This is echoed by weak negative relationships in five of the biogeographic realms separately, with a significant positive relationship between range size and species richness, contrary to Rapoport's rule, in the other three (Table 1). Nevertheless, relationships between richness and range area are likely to be heavily influenced by spatial autocorrelation, since neighbouring areas tend to contain largely the same numbers and average range sizes of species, and so do not contribute independent information to tests of association.    \nUsing spatial models, therefore, a rather different picture emerges. Globally, median range area and species richness remain significantly negatively related, as they do in four of the biogeographic realms (Table 1). However, within one region, Indomalaysia, a previously significant negative relationship becomes non-significant using a spatial model, and within two regions, the Neotropics and Australasia, significant positive correlations become significant negative relationships after controlling for spatial autocorrelation. In these last two regions, numerous grid cells falling within the Amazon basin and central Australian deserts dominate simple models. However, the similarity in species composition between these cells, as a consequence of the large range areas of the species occupying them, means that spatial autocorrelation is high across these areas. Their influence is dampened in spatial models in favour of less well-represented and less pseudo-replicated areas of high topographic variability and species richness but low geographic range area in the mountains of the Andes and Great Dividing Range. Thus, the fact that the richest areas house species with the smallest mean range areas was obscured by the numerical dominance of pseudo-replicated areas of lower richness housing species with broad geographic distributions. This emphasizes the potential importance of a spatially-explicit perspective in understanding large-scale biodiversity patterns, an approach that has almost been entirely lacking in previous considerations of spatial variations in geographic range size. It also suggests that whilst at a global scale for birds there is little support for Stevens' [2] notion of a general latitudinal gradient in range size, there is nonetheless some support for the link he suggested between geographic range size and species richness.    \nWe end with two notes of caution regarding the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that may underlie the relationship between geographic range size and species richness. First, although we have detected statistically significant associations between range area and species richness, the strength of these relationships is typically not strong. For those analyses based on non-spatial models the maximum proportion of variance explained was only 18% (Table 1), and for spatial models of the form employed here explained variances cannot be derived (the shallow slopes reflect the relative magnitudes of the two variables). It would thus be wrong to conclude that smaller range areas are strongly associated with higher levels of species richness, although there is robust evidence that the two variables are not entirely independent, both globally and within some biogeographic realms. Second, so far we have largely discussed the link between range area and species in the context of Stevens' [2] mass effect mechanism, but it is equally plausible that other mechanisms could underlie the same pattern. It has been suggested, for instance, that spatial patterns in geographic range size may be due to geographical variation in the processes of speciation and extinction that ultimately generate biodiversity [5,\n\t\t\t\t49]. Although recent studies have confirmed that there is geographic variation in the net rate of cladogenesis [5,\n\t\t\t\t50,\n\t\t\t\t51], the relative role of such phenomena in determining large-scale patterns of diversity remains to be discovered.    \nThe analyses presented here are based on a previously reported database [34] of distribution maps for 9,505 extant, recognized bird species following a standard avian taxonomy [52]. This excludes primarily marine species, the vast majority of the geographic ranges of which are oceanic and thus of quite different character, and for which comparable data are not available. Primarily marine species were defined as those regularly foraging more than 50 km from land during the breeding season (and thus for which land did not constitute a high proportion of their ranges), were identified using a variety of sources [53–58], and were excluded from the analyses presented here. To obtain information on the geographical breeding range data on a global scale we used a wide range of data sources [34], which are described in detail in       Protocol S1 along with the associated notes on methods and availability. Briefly, breeding ranges from the published sources were mapped as vectors or “polygons” and converted to an equal area grid for analysis. The grid used a Behrmann projection and a cell size (96.3 km) that gives a scale identical to 1° grids at the 30° latitude of true scale. The vertical cell boundaries coincide with 1° lines of longitude but the horizontal boundaries vary systematically in their latitudinal separation, giving a grid with 360 columns and 152 rows. We have used these 152 equal area longitudinal bands for calculating latitudinal averages and for binning species by their latitudinal range midpoint. Species were scored as present in a grid cell if any of the available vector sources suggested that the breeding range fell within the cell boundaries. Overall species richness was derived by summing all species present within each cell. Cell land areas were calculated using a coastline vector dataset [59] divided into continental and island land masses. The geographic range areas of individual species were estimated as the sum of the areas of the cells in which they were scored as occurring. This will tend disproportionately to overestimate the range areas of particularly narrowly distributed species, and those whose distributions are associated with linear features (e.g. mountain chains, rivers), but this is unlikely to influence the broad patterns reported here. Latitudinal extent was defined as the difference between the northern and southern limits of the vector maps showing each species' breeding range. Biogeographic realms were delimited using the World Wildlife Fund ecoregions map [60].\n\t\t\t\tTo calculate the logit transformation of geographic range area we used the global breeding area of all species as the upper limit to the occurrence of any individual species [43]. The shapes of logarithmically- or logit-transformed range area distributions were assessed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of the transformed data against normal distributions with mean and standard deviation taken from the transformed data. Species richness was untransformed or square root transformed for analyses, as appropriate, better to normalise distributions for particular tests. Relationships between median geographic range area/latitudinal extent or species richness and latitude were determined using correlation coefficients. Relationships between median geographic range area/latitudinal extent and species richness were determined using correlation coefficients, and using normal errors generalised least squares (GLS) models (SAS; 62), fitting spherical spatial covariance structures with longitudinal and latitudinal cell centroid values as spatial variables, in SAS version 9.1.3. GLS models took account of the differences among major biogeographical realms, in the maximum geographic distance or range parameter (ρ), measured in degrees, over which spatial autocorrelation in equivalent independent errors model residuals was observed to occur. This involved estimating ρ from the semi-variogram of residuals of non-spatial normal errors models that included the relevant combination of predictors, separately for each realm. All eight estimates of ρ were then entered as spatial covariance parameters in the model, with spatial autocorrelation assumed for observations within the same realm. Global models were run on a regular 50% grid of cells (chequerboard) in the full data set due to computer memory constraints (even when run on a mainframe); tests on regional subsets of the data confirmed that use of the reduced data set would not alter the conclusions.

            "fulltext": "Waters [1] makes a number of points concerning our article [2], which, in our view, require clarification. First, Waters states that classifying Southeast Asian highland groups as either strictly horticultural or strictly foraging is overly simplistic, as most groups practice horticulture supplemented with some degree of foraging. While we are sympathetic with the view that subsistence strategy is more complicated than a simple dichotomy (indeed, one of the main messages of our paper is that a strictly foraging group such as the Mlabri may have practiced horticulture in the past), we wish to emphasize that the Mlabri are, indeed, quite different from the other Southeast Asian highland groups in that they have never, in either their recorded or oral history, practiced horticulture. It is this distinction, coupled with their extreme paucity of genetic diversity, that sets them apart from other groups in the area.\nSecond, Waters suggests that our comparison of the Mlabri with hill tribes from a different geographic region (Chiang Rai and Mae Hong Son provinces of Thailand) leads to our conclusion that “the Mlabri were isolated from these groups,” and that had we examined neighboring groups of the Mlabri, we might have reached a different conclusion. These statements misrepresent our work; in particular, we found that the Mlabri were not genetically distinct from other hill tribes for which we had data, as the mtDNA sequence, Y-STR alleles, and autosomal STR alleles of the Mlabri are all found in other groups. Moreover, this sharing pattern is in stark contrast to African foraging groups, such as the !Kung and Pygmies, who are genetically distinct from their horticultural neighbors. It is precisely this sharing of alleles between the Mlabri and other groups that is the basis for our suggestion that the Mlabri may have reverted to their current exclusively foraging lifestyle from a previous horticultural lifestyle, rather than having always been foragers.\nFinally, Waters states that we claimed that our data “solidly” support the scenario of an extreme founder event from a horticultural group, followed by reversion to a foraging lifestyle, for the origin of the Mlabri. This is not true; we were careful to state that our data only suggest such a scenario. We agree with Waters that genetic analysis of neighboring groups of the Mlabri (in particular, the Tin Prai) would be useful to further evaluate the scenario we proposed for the origin of the Mlabri. And we clearly agree with Water's concluding statement concerning the importance of interactions between horticultural and foraging groups, as we make exactly that point in the penultimate sentence of our paper.\n"

                "\n        Water and energy have emerged as the best contemporary environmental correlates of broad-scale species richness patterns. A corollary hypothesis of water–energy dynamics theory is that the influence of water decreases and the influence of energy increases with absolute latitude. We report the first use of geographically weighted regression for testing this hypothesis on a continuous species richness gradient that is entirely located within the tropics and subtropics. The dataset was divided into northern and southern hemispheric portions to test whether predictor shifts are more pronounced in the less oceanic northern hemisphere. American palms (Arecaceae, n = 547 spp.), whose species richness and distributions are known to respond strongly to water and energy, were used as a model group. The ability of water and energy to explain palm species richness was quantified locally at different spatial scales and regressed on latitude. Clear latitudinal trends in agreement with water–energy dynamics theory were found, but the results did not differ qualitatively between hemispheres. Strong inherent spatial autocorrelation in local modeling results and collinearity of water and energy variables were identified as important methodological challenges. We overcame these problems by using simultaneous autoregressive models and variation partitioning. Our results show that the ability of water and energy to explain species richness changes not only across large climatic gradients spanning tropical to temperate or arctic zones but also within megathermal climates, at least for strictly tropical taxa such as palms. This finding suggests that the predictor shifts are related to gradual latitudinal changes in ambient energy (related to solar flux input) rather than to abrupt transitions at specific latitudes, such as the occurrence of frost.\n      "

            "fulltext": "IntroductionAmong the contemporary environmental factors that are correlated with species richness on broad scales, water and energy have emerged as key influences [1]–[4]. However, these two factors do not appear to be equally important worldwide. Based on a review of 85 studies of broad-scale richness gradients, Hawkins et al. [2] hypothesized that ‘the relative importance of the two components of water–energy dynamics shifts latitudinally’ (p. 3111). This conjecture has not received much attention (but see [5]), although appropriate tools exist for exploring spatial non-stationarity in environment–richness relationships [6]–[10].\nThe question of how patterns of species richness are controlled has been debated for decades [11], [12] and remains a central issue in macroecological and biogeographical research [13]–[15]. Various explanations have been proposed that emphasize the importance of area [16], geometric constraints [13], history [17], synergism between climate and history [18], and, most commonly, contemporary environment [2], [3], [19]. Many studies have focused on the role of contemporary climate as the main predictor of species richness, concluding in favor of a central role for water- and energy-related variables [2], [4], [19], [20]. Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the suggested primacy of water and energy, including trophic, physiological, and metabolic effects [2], [21], [22]. Fundamentally, a dynamic relationship between energy and water may result from life's dependence on both liquid water and ambient energy [2], [4], [20].\nOf interest, richness gradients at low latitudes appear to correlate most strongly with water availability, while energy (for animals) or water–energy variables (for plants) are the best correlates of most richness gradients at high latitudes [2]. This pattern finds a convincing a posteriori explanation in the latitudinal gradient of solar flux. Accordingly, energy is expected to be the most limiting factor at high latitudes where energy levels are low, while water gradients should be more important at low latitudes where ambient energy is high and thus not limiting [2]. For plants, the mechanism causing this predictor shift is thought to be related to physiological processes, while for animals it is more difficult to determine whether the shift results from direct physiological effects or from plant productivity [2], [4], [23]. Worth noting, the pattern appears to be asymmetric, with predictor shifts being largely restricted to the northern hemisphere, whereas water is more important than energy in most southern hemisphere regions [2]. A potential explanation may lie in the more oceanic climates of the southern hemisphere [2]. Increasing evidence also suggests that climate–richness relationships depend on evolutionary processes (e.g., [24]), which may introduce spatial non-stationarity. In particular, phylogenetic niche conservatism can cause groups to be most species rich in their ancestral climates [25]. To the extent that different groups originate from different climates, this mechanism may lead to climate–richness relationships that vary among groups and regions [24].\nSince the meta-analysis by Hawkins et al. [2], only one study has formally tested the hypothesized predictor shifts and found support for it for plants and animals in Europe [5]. The questions of whether predictor shifts are abrupt or gradual, at which latitudes they occur, whether they can be related to specific climatic transitions (such as the subtropical-temperate boundary), and to what degree those parameters are taxon-specific await further investigation.\nGeographical shifts in the explanatory power of environmental predictors are broadly relevant to macroecological research because they pose a challenge to ‘global’ models of biodiversity. Regression techniques that are typically used to analyze environment–richness relationships, such as ordinary least squares regression [1], generalized additive models (e.g. [5]), or spatial autoregressive models [26], assume that the relationship is described by one set of parameters that applies equally throughout the study area. It has been argued that such models are misleading if the analyzed relationship is indeed variable in space (spatial non-stationarity) [6] (but see [27]). If the purpose is simply to identify correlates of richness, the problem can be referred to the scale-dependency of environment–richness relationships [28], with different correlations on global and smaller scales correctly describing a given pattern. If, however, the purpose is to understand the actual drivers of richness, the ‘average’ parameters obtained from a global model [6], [29] might not be informative if the driving dynamics occur at a scale smaller than the model. It is therefore relevant to explore both scale-dependency and spatial non-stationarity of such relationships [6], [7]. Specifically, spatial non-stationarity is a promising source of information because the relationship as such can be related to (second-order) predictor variables.\nGeographically weighted regression (GWR) is a geographically local modeling technique specifically designed to deal with spatial non-stationarity in the modeled relationships [8]. GWR performs one weighted ordinary least squares regression per observation in the analyzed dataset. Weights are applied as a (typically inverse) function of the distance from the location of the ‘focal’ data point. Of importance, modeling is carried out at a scale smaller than the study extent, defined by the distance decay (‘bandwidth’) of the weighting function. Thus, GWR should not be used as an alternative to global regression models but as a complementary technique for quantifying spatial variability (non-stationarity) in relationships between the predictor and response variables [27]. By allowing regression model parameters to vary in space and then mapping these coefficients, GWR makes it possible to quantify and test the spatial variability in the species–environmental relationships. GWR is increasingly used for analyzing species richness patterns [6], [10], [22], [29], [30], [31], and some of these studies [22], [29], [30] have produced results that are in agreement with the predictor shifts conjectured by Hawkins et al. [2]. However, no study has to date applied GWR in a formal test of this hypothesis.\nUsing GWR, we tested for predictor shifts not by comparing disparate studies from different regions, but by quantifying geographic variation in the ability of water and energy to explain the species richness of a single group of organisms (palms) across a continuous region, the American tropics and subtropics. Palms are a diverse, pan-tropical family of ca. 2,400 species worldwide [32]. They are important constituents of many vegetation types in tropical, subtropical, and, more rarely, warm-temperate parts of the New World [33]. Several previous studies have investigated the controls of the large-scale diversity patterns in American palms and have found water-related variables to be of primary importance among contemporary environmental factors [34], [35]. Thus, as a low-latitude group when regarded on a global scale, the palms conform well to the conjecture of Hawkins et al. [2]. However, here we focus on assessing whether the relative importance of water and energy also changes with latitude within the range of palms. Moving away from the tropics, the American palms are likely to become more controlled by available energy than many other plant groups because of key aspects of palm architecture and anatomy that have been previously described [32], [36], [37]. Thus, they are good candidates for displaying latitudinal predictor shifts sensu Hawkins et al. [2] at relatively low latitudes. Here, we used GWR to formally test the following two predictions for a species-rich organism group within the tropics/subtropics: (1) Temperature is a stronger correlate of palm species richness at high latitudes than at low latitudes, while water shows the opposite trend, as hypothesized by Hawkins et al. [2]; (2) this latitudinal shift is strongest in the northern hemisphere, reflecting the more oceanic southern hemispheric climates.\nMethods\nStudy species and area\nWe used distribution data for the complete palm family (Arecaceae) across the Americas (n = 547 spp.) extracted using ArcView 9.2 (ESRI Inc., Redlands, California, USA) from the range maps in the Field Guide to the Palms of the Americas [38]. The number of palm species present was registered for all cells of a continuous grid covering the whole range of palms in the Americas ranging from 34° North to 33° South. Based on the quality of the maps and our knowledge of the distribution of the palm family, we decided to work at a resolution of 1°×1° grid cells. Cells with less than 25% land surface were excluded from the analysis because their species richness might be more strongly determined by area than by climate. Moreover, we excluded 59 also mostly coastal grid cells for which climate variables (see below) were not available. These criteria resulted in 1510 grid cells across the Americas (Figure S1).\n\n\nEnvironmental variables\nAs predictors, we used the environmental variables of mean annual precipitation (AP), minimum precipitation of the driest month (MPDM), mean annual temperature (MAT), and minimum temperature of the coldest month (MTCM) from the WorldClim global climate database [39] at a resolution of 30 arc seconds (http://www.worldclim.org/current). Moreover, we used potential evapotranspiration (PET) and actual evapotranspiration (AET) from the 30 arc minutes resolution UNEP GNV183 data set (www.grid.unep.ch/GRID_search_details.php​?dataid=GNV183/) [40]. To match the resolution of the palm grid cells, the average of each variable was taken for the terrestrial part of each 1°×1° grid cell using ArcInfo 10 (ESRI Inc., Redlands, California, USA). AET was only used to calculate water deficit (WD  =  PET – AET), representing drought [10]. We did not use AET directly because it represents both water and energy [41], running counter to the study purpose of separating these two aspects of climate. Thus, we worked with two sets of variables, one set denoting water (AP, MPDM, and WD), and one denoting energy (MAT, MTCM, and PET). Non-climatic variables were not included because the explicit aim was to infer the roles of water and energy, not to explain as much variation in species richness as possible (cf. [5]).\n\n\nStatistical analyses\nThe software SAM [42] was used to fit GWR models using palm species richness as the response variable and different combinations of climatic variables as predictors. In a first step, we performed information-theoretic model selection using the corrected Akaike information criterion (AICC; [43]) to determine which combination of predictor variables had the highest explanatory power within each set of climatic variables (water and energy, respectively). In each set, AICC was calculated for all possible combinations of one to three predictor variables.\nWe then computed local R2 values for the best water model, the best energy model, and a model including the predictor variables of both the best water model and the best energy model (‘combined model’ in the following). These values represent the fraction of local variation in palm richness explained by water (Rw) and energy (Re). For each grid cell, variation partitioning [44], [45] was performed to determine the amount of variation that is uniquely explained by water and energy. Those fractions were calculated as Rpe  =  Rt – Rw for pure energy and Rpw  =  Rt – Re for pure water, where Rt is the local R2 value of the combined model.\nThe results of GWR depend on the choice of the spatial kernel function that determines how observations are weighted as a function of spatial distance from the focal cell [6], [8], [46], [47]. To ensure that our conclusions did not depend on a specific choice of this function, we repeated all GWR analyses with four different kernels. First, we used the bi-square function, which applies a continuous, near-Gaussian weighting function up to a distance b (the ‘bandwidth’) from the regression point and then zero weights to any observation beyond b. Two values of b were used, 1200 km and 1800 km. Second, we used the moving window approach, which assigns equal weights to observations within the bandwidth and zero to observations beyond [8], with the same two b values. The bandwidths were chosen based on the resolution of the palm diversity data (1° × 1°, i.e., 111 km × 110 km at the equator) and the total extent of the study area (approx. 10,000 km between the most northerly and most southern data points) to ensure a reasonable local sample size and a scale that was clearly local relative to the whole study area. Because we were specifically interested in responses from the marginal areas (alone and not lumped together to obtain a certain number of grid cells), we did not use adaptive spatial kernels, which adapt the bandwidth according to the variation in observations so that it is large in areas with low density of data and smaller in areas with plenty of observations [8].\nTo determine how the amount of local variation in palm richness explained by water and energy changes with latitude, we regressed Re, Rpe, Rw, and Rpw on absolute latitude separately for the northern and southern hemispheres. This was done using both ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models [26]. The local results of GWR are inherently spatially autocorrelated because the local results for geographically close cells are based on overlapping datasets. Spatial autocorrelation may cause false significance of parameter estimates or bias the parameter estimates themselves, and it has even been reported to sometimes invert the relationship between predictor and response when standard OLS regression is used [26], [48]. Here, the spatial scale of inherent autocorrelation was related to the GWR kernel function (Fig. 1). The neighborhood and distance weighting for the SAR models was thus implemented using the same function as for the GWR kernel; for the local results of the 1200-km bi-square GWR, for example, we used a neighborhood of 1200 km and weighted the cells according to the bi-square function. Lagged SAR models were used because these are designed to model inherent (as opposed to induced) spatial autocorrelation [26]. All regression analyses were carried out in R 2.10.1 [49]; the package spdep 0.5-31 (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/s​pdep/index.html) was used for the SAR analyses.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.

Distance in km.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0027027.g001\nResultsThere was strong spatial heterogeneity in palm richness–climate relationships, as evidenced by a minimum AICC difference between GWR and OLS models of ΔAICC  =  663 (median 1515, maximum 3043) (Tables S1, S2, S3, S4). The model selection procedure clearly favored the models containing all water variables and all energy variables, respectively, with AICC differences of 108–179 and 103–146, depending on the GWR kernel, to the next best model (Tables S1, S2, S3, S4). Local R2 values also provided evidence for strong spatial heterogeneity in the importance of water and energy (Fig. 2). Of note, evidence was consistent for a decrease in the unique explanatory power of water (Rpw) with absolute latitude and a simultaneous increase in the unique explanatory power of energy (Rpe; Tables 1 and 2, Fig. 3). Latitudinal trends in the amount of variation of palm richness that is locally explained by water or energy (Fig. 3) were largely robust to the choice of models, i.e., the spatial kernel used in GWR and the use of OLS vs. SAR models for evaluating the GWR results against latitude (Tables 1 and 2). Different model combinations produced no significant latitudinal trends of opposite sign, but relationships were non-significant in some cases (Tables 1 and 2).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 2.

Latitudinal trends in the amount of variation in American palm species richness locally explained by water and energy (SAR).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0027027.t002As was apparent from the mapping of the local R2 values and fractions of variation uniquely explained by water and energy (Fig. 2), the GWR results exhibited strong spatial autocorrelation (Fig. 1), as expected based on the functional principles of GWR. However, comparison of the OLS and SAR results showed that this autocorrelation did not qualitatively affect the estimated latitudinal relationships (Tables 1 and 2, Fig. 3).\nWater–energy dynamics theory predicts that species richness is primarily controlled by the availability of water and ambient energy, with water being most influential at low latitudes and energy being most influential at high latitudes [2]. Results from our tests using American palms as a model group strongly support this latitudinal predictor shift (Tables 1 and 2). Similar water–energy predictor shifts have also been found for European mammals, birds, amphibians, and plants [5]. Whittaker et al. [5] used global modeling techniques on separate northern and southern datasets and found that energy had a relatively larger contribution to explained variance in northern data. Evidence also indicates that the relationship between Australian pteridophyte richness and water becomes weaker towards higher latitudes, while the relationship with temperature becomes stronger [30]. Similar conclusions have been drawn for American amphibians [29] and European dragonflies [22]. These three studies used GWR but did not involve statistical analysis of the resulting spatial patterns.Here, we moved beyond previous tests of water–energy dynamics theory in several ways. Water–energy predictor shifts were originally observed between tropical/subtropical areas, where water is the dominant environmental predictor of plant species richness, and temperate areas, where energy or water–energy variables are most influential [2]. For detection of such a shift, the analysis must include a part of the climatic gradient in which energy is clearly limiting for the studied taxon (either in terms of physiology, productivity, or food availability). In the previously studied taxa, this shift seems to occur at relatively high latitudes, usually north of the transition between subtropics and tropics (see [2], [5] for examples). Our results show that latitudinal predictor shifts can also occur within the tropical/subtropical zone, at least for megathermal taxa such as palms. Palms are thought to be maladapted to meso- or microthermal climates because of their soft and water-rich tissue, their inability to undergo dormancy, and their lack of physiological adaptations to frost [37]. These characteristics are obviously highly phylogenetically conserved, making the palms a prime example of a group that fits the tropical conservatism hypothesis [25]. Palms exhibit a strong latitudinal gradient of diversity in the Americas, with highest diversity close to the equator and no species beyond 34°Ν and 34°S [34], [35], [50]. In line with the expectations of water–energy dynamics theory for low latitudes, the broad-scale pattern of palm diversity in the Americas is best explained by water [34], [35], but energy plays an additional role [50]–[52]. Given that the latitudinal limits of palm occurrence are almost certainly set by low temperatures [53], an influence of energy especially on the high-latitude tails of the diversity gradient is plausible.The prediction that the latitudinal predictor shift is strongest in the northern hemisphere [2] is not supported by our results. Neither the magnitude nor the significance of the latitudinal trends in variable importance differ systematically between the hemispheres (Tables 1 and 2). This finding is likely due to our study being restricted to tropical and subtropical latitudes, where climatic gradients apparently do not differ strongly enough between the hemispheres to entail significant differences in latitudinal predictor shifts. Such differences may still be found in taxa that extend into temperate or arctic zones.Previous groups have tested for latitudinal differences in the predictive power of variables by dividing datasets into latitudinal bands [2], [5]. Central to this approach is finding the appropriate latitudinal threshold at which to split the dataset, and interpretation relies on the assumption that relationships are stationary within each latitudinal band. If this is not the case, ‘global’ models such as OLS or SAR models provide average estimates that can be difficult to interpret because they may not apply to any of the location within the study region [6], [29]. GWR is specifically designed to deal with geographic non-stationarity of model coefficients [6]–[8]. It is therefore a suitable approach to studying predictor shifts if no good argument can be made for dividing the dataset at a particular point, or spatial stationarity within the partial dataset is not guaranteed.A downside of GWR compared to the latitudinal-bands approach is that the datasets used for local models overlap excessively, resulting in strong spatial autocorrelation of local coefficient estimates (Fig. 1). Our results illustrate how difficult it is to visually interpret GWR results because of the high degree of inherent spatial autocorrelation; latitudinal trends are not that obvious when R2 values are mapped (Fig. 2). Moreover, OLS regressions that use local GWR results as the dependent variable are prone to bias because of the inherently strong spatial autocorrelation. The use of lagged SAR models is a way to overcome this bias [26], so that GWR results can be used to quantify the strength and shape of predictor shifts along latitudinal (or other) gradients.GWR is also an efficient tool for exploring the scale-dependency of relationships [6], [7], [27]. Predictors of species richness are thought to vary systematically with spatial scale [28]; this effect is also well documented for palms [36]. Predictor shifts sensu Hawkins et al. [2] might therefore depend on the scale at which climate–richness relationships are quantified. In the present study, the GWR bandwidth defined this scale. Latitudinal trends in energy and water effects on palm richness emerged irrespective of the scale of the GWR analysis (1200 km vs. 1800 km bandwidth). Smaller bandwidths were not used because GWR tends to over-fit at very small scales, leading to unrealistic R2 values [27]; and larger bandwidths were not used because they would approach the extent of the total dataset and therefore not allow for sufficient geographic variability. However, our results indicate that the observed latitudinal trends are not restricted to a certain spatial scale.To our knowledge, no previous study, whether it used global or local modeling techniques, has quantified the independent effects of water and energy on species richness. Our results show that taking into account parallel or synergistic effects of water and energy can strongly influence conclusions when testing for predictor shifts. When the water was analyzed irrespective of energy (“total water,” Tables 1 and 2), the influence of water increased with latitude in the northern hemisphere in contrast to the predictions [2]. However, this finding for the northern hemisphere seems to be the result of an interaction with energy. When variation partitioning [44], [45] was used to identify the amount of local variation in palm species richness that is uniquely explained by water-related variables (“pure water,” Tables 1 and 2), the expected negative relationship emerged also for the northern hemisphere. This finding suggests that studies that compare the explanatory power of variables (or sets of variables) without taking the interactions of these variables into account (e.g., [30], [54]) must be interpreted with caution.Scale dependency and spatial non-stationarity are prevalent features of environment–richness relationships and require consideration in the effort to explain spatial patterns of species diversity. Parallel to the current progress in finding global determinants of diversity (e.g., [55]) and understanding their scaling (e.g., [56]), evidence is accumulating for predictable patterns of spatial non-stationarity. Increases in the predictive power of water and decreases in the predictive power of energy variables with absolute latitude have been documented across continents, climatic zones, and taxa [2], [5], [22], [29], [30]; the current work now extends that to the tropics/subtropics. However, more exploration is needed into the universality of this relationship, its shape, and its variation across taxa. GWR or similar local modeling techniques are more powerful tools for this task than traditional ‘global’ models but are not without issues, and further statistical development is desirable, especially concerning spatial autocorrelation both at the level of single (local) models and the overall GWR fit."

                ": Using cross-sectional survey data, Rachel Pullan and colleagues map geographical inequalities in use of improved drinking water supply and sanitation across sub-Saharan Africa. Background: Understanding geographic inequalities in coverage of drinking-water supply and sanitation (WSS) will help track progress towards universal coverage of water and sanitation by identifying marginalized populations, thus helping to control a large number of infectious diseases. This paper uses household survey data to develop comprehensive maps of WSS coverage at high spatial resolution for sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Analysis is extended to investigate geographic heterogeneity and relative geographic inequality within countries. Methods and Findings: Cluster-level data on household reported use of improved drinking-water supply, sanitation, and open defecation were abstracted from 138 national surveys undertaken from 1991–2012 in 41 countries. Spatially explicit logistic regression models were developed and fitted within a Bayesian framework, and used to predict coverage at the second administrative level (admin2, e.g., district) across SSA for 2012. Results reveal substantial geographical inequalities in predicted use of water and sanitation that exceed urban-rural disparities. The average range in coverage seen between admin2 within countries was 55% for improved drinking water, 54% for use of improved sanitation, and 59% for dependence upon open defecation. There was also some evidence that countries with higher levels of inequality relative to coverage in use of an improved drinking-water source also experienced higher levels of inequality in use of improved sanitation (rural populations r = 0.47, p = 0.002; urban populations r = 0.39, p = 0.01). Results are limited by the quantity of WSS data available, which varies considerably by country, and by the reliability and utility of available indicators. Conclusions: This study identifies important geographic inequalities in use of WSS previously hidden within national statistics, confirming the necessity for targeted policies and metrics that reach the most marginalized populations. The presented maps and analysis approach can provide a mechanism for monitoring future reductions in inequality within countries, reflecting priorities of the post-2015 development agenda. Background: Access to a safe drinking-water supply (a water source that is protected from contamination) and to adequate sanitation facilities (toilets, improved latrines, and other facilities that prevent people coming into contact with human urine and feces) is essential for good health. Unimproved drinking-water sources and sanitation are responsible for 85% of deaths from diarrhea and 1% of the global burden of disease. They also increase the transmission of parasitic worms and other neglected tropical diseases. In 2000, world leaders set a target of reducing the proportion of the global population without access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation to half of the 1990 level by 2015 as part of Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 7 (“Ensure environmental sustainability”; the MDGs are designed to improve the social, economic, and health conditions in the world's poorest countries). Between 1990 and 2010, more than 2 billion people gained access to improved drinking-water sources and 1.8 billion gained access to improved sanitation. In 2011, 89% of the world's population had access to an improved drinking-water supply, 1% above the MDG target, and 64% had access to improved sanitation (the MDG target is 75%). Why Was This Study Done?: Despite these encouraging figures, the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) estimates that, globally, 768 million people relied on unimproved drinking-water sources, 2.5 billion people did not use an improved sanitation facility, and more than 1 billion people (15% of the global population) were defecating in the open in 2011. The JMP estimates for 2011 also reveal national and sub-national inequalities in drinking-water supply and sanitation coverage but a better understanding of geographic inequalities is needed to track progress towards universal coverage of access to improved water and sanitation and to identify the populations that need the most help to achieve this goal. Here, the researchers use cross-sectional household survey data and modern statistical approaches to produce a comprehensive map of the coverage of improved drinking-water supply and improved sanitation at high spatial resolution for sub-Saharan Africa and to investigate geographic inequalities in coverage. Cross-sectional household surveys collect health and other information from households at a single time-point, including data on use of safe water and improved sanitation. What Did the Researchers Do and Find?: The researchers extracted data on reported household use of an improved drinking-water supply (for example, a piped water supply), improved sanitation facilities (for example, a flushing toilet), and open defecation from 138 national household surveys undertaken between 1991 and 2012 in 41 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. They developed statistical models to fit these data and used the models to estimate coverage at the district (second administrative) level across sub-Saharan Africa for 2012. For ten countries, the estimated coverage of access to improved drinking water at the district level within individual countries ranged from less than 25% to more than 75%. Within-country ranges of a similar magnitude were estimated for coverage of access to improved sanitation  (21 countries) and for open defecation (16 countries). Notably, rural households in the districts with the lowest coverage of access to improved water supply and sanitation within a country were 1.5–8 times less likely to access improved drinking water, 2–18 times less likely to access improved sanitation, and 2–80 times more likely to defecate in the open than rural households in districts with the best coverage. Finally, countries with high levels of inequality in improved drinking-water source coverage also experienced high levels of inequality in improved sanitation coverage. What Do These Findings Mean?: These findings identify important geographic inequalities in the coverage of access to improved water sources and sanitation that were previously hidden within national statistics. The accuracy of these findings depends on the accuracy of the data on water supplies and sanitation provided by household surveys, on the researchers' definitions for improved water supplies and sanitation, and on their statistical methods. Nevertheless, these findings confirm that, to achieve universal coverage of access to improved drinking-water sources and sanitation, strategies that target the areas with the lowest coverage are essential. Moreover, the maps and the analytical approach presented here provide the means for monitoring future reductions in inequalities in the coverage of access to improved water sources and sanitation and thus reflect a major priority of the post-2015 development agenda.

            "fulltext": "IntroductionRemarkable gains have been made in the provision of drinking-water supply and sanitation (WSS) globally, with over 2 billion people reportedly gaining access to improved drinking-water sources and 1.8 billion to improved sanitation between 1990 and 2010 [1]. The WHO and UNICEF's Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) has reported that the world is “on track” to reach the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target for water supply of reducing by half the proportion of the population without access to sustainable and safe water [1]. In spite of such global gains, important national and sub-national inequalities in WSS coverage remain, including significant rural-urban and regional disparities [1],[2]. National studies also highlight systematic inequalities in WSS access, typically focusing on rural-urban or socio-economic disparities and coverage in hard to reach groups [3]–[9].\nAccess to safe water and sanitation facilities is a fundamental human right. Unimproved drinking water and sanitation are responsible for an estimated 1% of global disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) [10], and 85% of diarrhoea mortality can be attributed to inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene practices (WaSH) [11]. Populations with inadequate WSS are also disproportionately affected by the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) [12]–[17], and as such WSS are increasingly recognised as critical for sustaining the impact of control and elimination strategies that rely on geographically targeted mass drug administration [18],[19]. There have however been few published analyses of sub-national geographical distribution of WSS at policy relevant scales. To better understand inequality within and between countries, and provide a bench mark for tracking progress and help prioritize resource allocation, there is a clear need to develop policy-relevant data on sub-national inequality and a standardised approach to mapping sub-national coverage in WSS.\nPopulation-based national household cluster-sample surveys, such as demographic and health surveys (DHS) and multiple indicator cluster surveys (MICS), provide a wealth of information on the coverage of health and development indicators, including WSS, within countries and have been used previously to map geographical variation in bed net coverage [20], anaemia [21], and under-nutrition [22]. There is an important trade-off however between accuracy and spatial resolution that must be resolved before these data can be truly useful for stakeholders. Surveys are usually powered to provide accurate data for provinces or regions, although access to WSS is likely to vary markedly at this spatial scale. Modern statistical approaches, including small area estimation (SAE) and Bayesian spatial conditional autoregressive (CAR) models, can help tackle the problem of providing feasible estimates for smaller geographical areas, whilst explicitly acknowledging uncertainty associated with data powered to be representative at larger spatial scales [23]–[27].\nIn this paper we combine multiple national surveys using spatial statistical methods to investigate differences in use of improved drinking water, improved sanitation, and open defecation at small spatial scales; identify specific geographical areas where coverage is substantially worse than national averages; and explore relative geographic inequalities within countries. Our analysis focuses on sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), as this is the region where progression towards the MDGs for water and sanitation is often least successful [1],[28]. Our intent is not to replace existing national JMP estimates, but instead to develop robust maps of contemporary WSS coverage at a finer spatial resolution useful for service delivery providers, policy makers and those planning investment within governments, implementers, and donors. The work is conducted within the context of the Global Atlas of Helminth Infections project (www.thiswormyworld.org), which aims to develop a suite of geographical resources and tools for NTD control.\nMethods\nData Sources\nWSS data were sourced from national household cluster-sample surveys undertaken as part of multiple indicator cluster surveys (MICS) (http://www.childinfo.org/mics4_surveys.h​tml; implementation supported by UNICEF), Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and national malaria and AIDS indicator surveys (MIS/AIS) (http://www.measuredhs.com/data/available​-datasets.cfm; USAID) and living standard measurement studies (LSMS) (http://iresearch.worldbank.org/lsms/lsms​surveyFinder.htm; World Bank). These surveys are based on probability sampling using existing sampling frames (primarily population censuses) and are conducted by trained enumerators conducting household visits, typically achieving household response rates >97%. Informed consent is obtained from all respondents before participating. All available DHS, MICs, and LSMS surveys conducted in SSA since 1990 that contained the necessary modules to calculate household WSS use were included (n = 138 surveys) [29]. Access to improved drinking water and sanitation were defined using the criteria outlined by the JMP, and are measured by reported use. For MDG monitoring, improved sanitation facilities are defined as those that “hygienically separate human excreta from human contact,” whilst improved (“safe”) drinking-water sources are defined as those that are “protected from outside contamination (especially faecal contamination).” The proportion of households reporting open defecation was also recorded. In the subset of data where distance to water source was available (n = 121 surveys), we also recorded the proportion of households using an accessible, improved drinking water source. This was defined as one within 1 km (or 15 minutes) of the household, which has been suggested as an appropriate distance for meeting the MDG targets [30]. Further details of indicator definition, and comparison with those used by the JMP, are provided in Box 1.\n\nBox 1. Comparison with the Joint Monitoring Programme Methodology\n\nData availability\n\n\n\n\nAvailable data sources included in this analysis (DHS, MICs, and LSMS) make up 42% percent of all data in the JMP database for the same countries. Data available to the JMP that could not be used in this analysis include national surveys implemented by governments and census data.\n\n\n\nCommon definitions\n\n\n\n\nImproved sources of drinking water: piped water into the dwelling; piped water to yard/plot/compound; public tap or standpipe; tubewell or borewell; protected dug well; protected spring; rainwater.\n\nImproved sanitation: flush toilet; piper sewer system; septic tank; ventilated improved pit latrine (VIP); pit latrine with slab; composting toilet.\n\nOpen defecation: No facilities or bush or field.\n\nNot used by JMP. Accessible, improved drinking water source: an improved drinking water source (see above) within either 1 km or 15 minutes from the household. Data available in 85% of surveys.\n\n\n\nShared sanitation facilities\n\n\n\n\nContrasting variable definition: JMP classify all shared facilities as unimproved, and make assumptions on the proportion shared when this data are not available. In our main analysis, we do not distinguish between shared and private sanitation facilities as this information is only available for 70% of included surveys, although a sub-analysis is performed to compare differences\n\nImplications: Coverage of improved sanitation in countries with large numbers of households reporting shared facilities will be considerably higher than current JMP estimates\n\n\n\nUnimproved pit latrines\n\n\n\n\nContrasting variable definition: older DHS surveys (phase 4 and earlier, pre-2003) do not distinguish the type of pit latrine (improved or unimproved), and for these surveys JMP make assumptions on the proportion that can be classified as improved. In our analysis all such latrines were included as unimproved to avoid misclassification.\n\nImplications: In our analysis past coverage may have been underestimated for countries with older DHS surveys, and temporal gains in coverage overestimated.\n\n\n\nMethodology\n\n\n\n\nJMP methods: for each country, separate linear time trends are fit through national (rural and urban) coverage estimates from survey and census data. Regression slopes are extrapolated two years outside available data; beyond this slope is assumed to be zero for a maximum of six years after which estimates are not made. Population averaging (to determine rural, urban, and overall coverage rates) relies on reported survey weights.\n\nSpatial multilevel methods: data from all countries are treated as a continuous time series and fit within a single multilevel model. This considers the hierarchical structure of the whole dataset: surveys sites are nested within administrative areas, within countries. The model estimates an average intercept and an average slope with residual variances across countries, whilst accounting for sub-national spatial correlation and non-spatial variation. In practice, this means that when there is reliable information for a specific country, predictions will closely follow the country survey points, whereas when there is little temporal (or sub-nationally disaggregated) information trends will tend to follow the regional (or national) mean. Population averaging uses high resolution population data generated by the WorldPop project [33],[34].\n\n\n\nFor each of the available surveys, the proportion of households reporting use of an improved drinking water source, improved sanitation, and open defecation were calculated at the cluster (survey site) level. Each survey site was then coded as either urban or rural as defined by the survey and was allocated, where possible, to sub-national administrative areas. For reference, in most SSA countries first administrative areas (admin1, often referred to as provinces, regions, or states) represent on average approximately 1.35 million people and are typically further subdivided into three to 15 second administrative areas (admin2, often referred to as districts, representing approximately 200,000 people). Admin1 and admin2 digital boundaries were derived for each country using the United Nations Second Administrative Level Boundaries dataset project (SALB) ([31]): for 74 surveys, survey sites were linked to admin2 using the provided survey site co-ordinates, whilst admin1 and admin2 names were used to match survey site locations for the remaining 64 surveys. For 45 of these, survey sites could be matched to admin1 only as admin2 names were not available. In these instances, survey site data were attributed to all admin2 contained within the admin1 boundaries, and weighted to reflect the number of admin2 this represented. No survey data were available for Botswana and Eritrea, and these countries (representing 0.85% of the population of SSA) are therefore not included in the analysis.\nDigital gridded population surfaces and urban/peri-urban extent maps for 2012 at 100 m2 resolution were provided by the WorldPop project [32],[33]. These population surfaces were used in combination with the admin2 boundaries to extract total admin2 populations and the proportion of each admin2 population living in urban/peri-urban and rural areas. As a confirmation step, the overall proportion urban generated for each country for 2012 was compared with estimates produced by the UN Urbanization Prospects [34] suggesting good agreement (r = 0.72, p<0.001).\n\n\nData Analysis\nFor each country, available data for urban and rural populations were plotted on a timescale from 1990 to 2012, and the temporal trend examined visually. Access to improved water and sanitation has risen approximately linearly over time, although there are large differences in this trend between countries, and between urban and rural populations within countries. It was therefore decided that a random coefficient model incorporating a linear time trend would be appropriate, allowing different intercepts and temporal slopes for urban and rural populations by country, but assuming an overall linear change over time.\nFor each water and sanitation indicator, spatially explicit logistic regression models were therefore developed and fitted using a Bayesian framework. These consider the hierarchical structure of the whole dataset: survey sites are nested within admin2, which are themselves nested within admin1 and countries. Instead of calculating an intercept and slope separately for each country, as is currently done by the JMP, the multilevel model estimates an average intercept and an average slope for rural and urban populations, with residual variances across countries. Neighbouring admin2 within countries are also expected to have similar coverage rates, and so an admin2-level random effect is included that explicitly models the correlation between neighbouring admin2 within countries using a conditional autoregressive (CAR) covariance structure. Models also include a regional random effect with an unstructured covariance structure, to account for non-spatial dependence between survey sites within admin1 areas. A detailed description of the model is given in Text S1.\nEssentially, the model structure implies that countries with scarce data over time will follow the mean trend, whilst countries with reliable information (i.e., several surveys across multiple time points) will closely follow the survey points with less associated uncertainty. Similarly, when there is little spatially disaggregated data available, sub-national predictions will follow national means, whilst if data coverage at the admin2 level is good (i.e., survey sites located in admin2 throughout the country) admin2-level coverage will be smoothed towards local, neighbouring values thus counteracting the problem of outliers resulting from under-sampling. Models were fit within a Bayesian framework in the software package WinBUGS [35] using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, a robust and flexible inference platform that is well suited to complex problems and that explicitly incorporates uncertainty in input data and model parameters. MCMC is an iterative, stochastic simulation technique, and as such this uncertainty is represented in the form of predictive posterior distributions.\n\n\nPredicting Coverage in 2012 and Analysis of Geographical Inequality\nThe developed models were used to predict coverage of water and sanitation for the urban and rural populations of each admin2 for 2012; overall population estimates are population-weighted averages of the urban and rural numbers. Following the approach of Gomez-Rubio and colleagues [24] and Banerjee and colleagues [36], we used information provided by the spatially correlated admin2-level random effect to make predictions for admin2 without data, as detailed in Text S1. To prevent unstable predictions for areas with few or no neighbours with data, this was only performed for countries with available data at admin2 level. For seven countries with no data located at admin2 level, predictions were made for admin1 only. At each MCMC iteration, multiplying the urban and rural population surfaces with the admin2 predicted coverage (or where applicable, coverage by admin1) and then aggregating allowed estimation for the overall population locally and nationally. Resulting uncertainty in predicted coverage will vary geographically, depending on observed sampling variation and the density of survey sites within countries and across time.\nSub-national inequality was evaluated using absolute and relative measures. As absolute measures, the range of coverage (by admin2) for each country was computed, and admin2 with coverage significantly lower (and higher) than the national mean identified based on 95% Bayesian credible intervals (BCIs). As a country-level measure of sub-national relative inequality, we developed a relative geographic inequality (RGI) index, derived from a geographical GINI coefficient. The GINI coefficient is a measure commonly used to describe the distribution of income within a country [37], and has been widely adapted for other applications, including measuring inequalities in health care provision [38],[39] and disease incidence across population groups [40]. It is based on the Lorenz curve, an accumulated frequency curve that compares the distribution of a specific variable with a uniform distribution that represents equality. To calculate Lorenz curves for each country, administrative areas were ranked smallest to largest by their share of national use; the cumulative proportion of use was then calculated and plotted against the cumulative percentage of population. The greater the deviation of the Lorenz curve from the diagonal line of equal distribution, the greater the inequality. The GINI coefficient was then calculated as twice the area between the diagonal and the Lorenz curve. Values can range from 0 to 1, with 0 representing perfect equality and 1 total inequality [37]. Importantly however, in contrast to income, WSS coverage is a bounded variable (i.e., it cannot fall outside the range 0%–100%) and as such the GINI coefficient would be expected to decline as coverage increases. Outlier countries (with higher or lower levels of inequality given their level of coverage) were thus identified using linear regression of GINI coefficient against national coverage for overall, rural, and urban populations and the RGI score generated as the difference between the observed and expected GINI coefficient given national coverage based upon this modelled relationship. This approach draws upon the methods of Jamison and colleagues in their investigation of the relationship between survival curves and life expectancy, which follow similar rules [41]. In the case of open defecation, the GINI and RGI scores were calculated on the basis of households not reporting open defecation (i.e., with access to any type of sanitation) to enable better comparison with the other variables.\n\n\nEthics Statement\nThis is a secondary analysis of previously collected and published household survey data, and as such ethical approval was not required for this work. Ethical clearance for each included survey was provided by review boards in each country, with informed consent provided by all participants. Details of this process vary by survey.\n\nResults\nNational WSS Coverage\nIn total, we obtained 138 DHS, MICs, and LSMS surveys conducted between 1991 and 2012, representing over 1.15 million households from over 50,000 survey sites located in 2,751 admin2 across SSA (outlined in Table 1). Figure 1 emphasises the high data coverage in West and East Africa, and low coverage in much of Southern and Central Africa. Data coverage was very limited for South Sudan and much of Angola.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.

Model results suggest that in 2010, 62.0% (95% BCI: 61.5%–62.4%) of the population of SSA (excluding Eritrea and Botswana) reported using an improved drinking-water source, although at national levels this was seen to vary between as low as 11.5% (95% BCI: 6.2%–19.0%) in rural Somali populations to 99.0% (95% BCI: 98.7%–99.3%) in urban populations in Namibia. Similar ranges are seen for reported use of improved sanitation: whilst we predict that 42.5% (95% BCI: 42.1%–43.1%) of the total population in SSA used improved sanitation, this ranges from less than 30% for 11 countries to greater than 70% in the top four performing countries (Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, and Rwanda). For six countries, it is estimated that at least 50% of households habitually defecate in the open (Niger, Namibia, Benin, Burkina Faso, South Sudan, and Chad).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 2.

National estimates and admin2 summaries resulting from the modelling procedures for access to improved drinking-water source, improved sanitation, and open defecation.doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.1001626.t002For 30 countries there was sufficient survey data to investigate reported use of accessible, improved drinking water supply (defined as those <1 km away or within a 30-minute round trip) and for 27 countries sufficient survey data to investigate reported use of private, improved sanitation (defined as one that is not shared with another household). Overall, in 2012 only 55.0% of rural populations using an improved drinking water source used an “accessible” source (range: 23.9% in Uganda to 98.8% in Namibia) rising to 74.1% of urban populations (range: 39.9% in Cote d'Ivoire to 95.8% in Mali). As can be seen in Figure 3, this urban-rural disparity is less apparent for private and shared improved sanitation: overall, 54.1% of rural populations using improved sanitation had access to a private latrine (range: 12.6% in Liberia to 88.7% in Mozambique) compared with 48.9% of urban populations (range: 14.4% in Togo to 82.7% in Mozambique). Given the reduced data availability for these additional indicators, further analysis at a sub-national level is restricted to use of any improved drinking-water source and any improved sanitation facility.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 3.

For ten countries, admin2-level coverage in use of an improved drinking-water source ranged within country from less than 25% to over 75%; within-country ranges of the same magnitude were seen for improved sanitation for 21 countries and open defecation for 16 countries. Figure 4 highlights those admin2 where coverage of both improved drinking water and improved sanitation were significantly lower than national averages based on 95% BCIs (shown in red), highlighting the considerable overlap in admin2 with low access to improved drinking water and improved sanitation. Similarly, when considering all countries in SSA, correlation between admin2-level coverage of improved drinking water and improved sanitation is reasonably high (r = 0.44, p<0.001) although as can be seen in Figure 5 this varies considerably by country.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 4.

For access to improved sanitation (where coverage is generally lower) a larger number of countries display a top inequality pattern, meaning that coverage in the top quintile is substantially higher than the rest (e.g., Ethiopia, Gabon, Mali, Mozambique, Madagascar, South Africa). In contrast, several countries (including Malawi, Chad, and Sudan) display very little variation between quintiles, especially for access to improved sanitation.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 6.

As would be expected, plotting GINI against national coverage reveals strong negative relationships for all three indicators (range in r −0.78 to −0.88, p<0.001); the linear regression of GINI scores against national coverage thus provides a straightforward mechanism for identifying outlier countries with lower, or higher, levels of inequality than would be expected given their level of coverage. As shown in Figure 7, there are a number of outliers for all three WSS indicators, most noticeably for use of improved sanitation. For use of improved drinking water and any type of sanitation, higher than expected levels of inequality are seen across the full range of national coverage. In contrast, for use of improved sanitation countries with low national coverage are more likely to have higher than expected levels of geographical inequality. There are also some notable outliers with lower than expected geographical inequality given their national coverage rates, especially in access to improved sanitation. The first of these is South Sudan, although this is most likely due to a paucity of data to adequately describe sub-national variation. However Congo, Malawi, and Sierra Leone all display low geographical inequality in access to both improved drinking water and sanitation.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 7.

There was no evidence for correlation between RGI scores for improved drinking water and sanitation for the overall population at national levels (r = 0.18, p>0.2). When considering rural and urban populations separately however, there was some evidence that countries with higher levels of relative inequality for use of an improved drinking-water source (i.e., positive RGI scores) also experienced higher levels of inequality for use of improved sanitation (shown in Figure 8; rural populations r = 0.47, p = 0.002; urban populations r = 0.39, p = 0.01).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 8.

To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically map and analyse geographical inequalities in WSS within countries. We selected three widely reported WSS coverage indicators (access to improved drinking water, access to improved sanitation, and open defecation) and have generated a new resource for researchers and country stakeholders. Our robust analytical approaches, which explore geographical heterogeneity and geographic inequalities, showed consistent findings for all the three indicators that have important implications not only for the WSS sector, but also the international public health and development communities, policy makers, and donors.In October 2013, key sector stakeholders issued a joint statement calling on the international community to ensure that the post-2015 development agenda be framed around the principle of equality, emphasising that future goals, targets, and indicators must rely on disaggregated data to allow inequalities to be effectively measured [42]. Our results suggest that there are substantial geographical inequalities in use of WSS across SSA that surpass simple urban-rural disparities and are of similar magnitude to the large socio-economic inequalities highlighted in a number of national studies [2]–[8],[12],[43]–[45]. In almost all countries, rural households in lowest coverage admin2 were 1.5 to 8 times less likely to access improved drinking water, 2 to 18 times less likely to access improved sanitation, and 2 to 80 times more likely to defecate in the open than rural households with the best access. Even across urban populations, coverage in use of improved drinking water varies on average by 30% nationally, use of improved sanitation by 5%, and dependence upon open defecation by 26% nationally, emphasising how population growth and rapid urbanisation may frequently outstrip service provision in poorer urban areas [46]. Considerable overlap in those admin2 with significantly worse coverage than the national average for both improved drinking water and improved sanitation suggests that vulnerable and marginalized populations often suffer the compounded effects of unsafe water and poor sanitation.Perhaps our most striking finding, however, is that high geographical inequality (i.e., higher than would be expected given absolute national coverage) was seen across all levels of national coverage, although for improved sanitation this was typically greater than would be expected for those countries with lowest national coverage. In addition, those countries with high levels of relative inequality in improved drinking water also experienced higher levels of relative inequality in use of improved sanitation. This finding suggests that countries struggling to increase coverage often also struggle with issues of poor targeting of resources, or patchy implementation of government or NGO delivered interventions, and need to develop strategies and investment plans with reduction of inequalities in mind. Notably, evidence from across the public health and development arena suggests that, unless governments and stakeholders deliberately adopt strategies aimed at reaching lowest coverage areas and population groups, it is unlikely that countries will achieve universal coverage [43],[47]–[49]. It is likely that areas without access to improved water supply and basic sanitation are not only the poorest, but most challenging in terms of environmental conditions and demand for resilient infrastructure, such as low or inconsistent rainfall, poor soils and deep water tables, and a paucity of available markets and materials. The publication in 2012 of the first quantitative aquifer storage maps for the African continent reveals that most countries have the potential for sufficient well-placed hand-pumps to support rural populations; however, the potential for higher yielding boreholes (required to support rapid urbanisation) is limited and will require careful planning [50]. We hope that the information presented here, when combined with quantitative mapping of groundwater resources at sub-national levels, can provide a useful tool to accurately target WSS investments geographically to those admin2 where they are most needed. These data also demonstrate the promise of using geographically disaggregated data as a complementary tool to stratifying on the basis of socio-economic status [51] when systematically measuring progress in reducing inequalities within low coverage countries.It is commonly recognised that there is no ideal measure for expressing the magnitude of inequalities [37],[52],[53], and as such we have presented both absolute (within country ranges and quintiles) and relative measures. Despite an increasing focus on spatial analysis within health research, there are relatively few publications concerning measurement methods for geographic inequality in health outcomes [54]–[57], and very few papers have explored the use of absolute or relative metrics for sub-national coverage data such as this [58],[59]. We have developed an RGI score, an adaptation of the GINI coefficient. This widely applied coefficient is a ratio analysis measure, and is independent of scale and population size, making it helpful for comparing diverse countries and groups within countries, such as urban and rural populations. It also takes full account of the entire distribution, rather than simply comparing those at the extremes. However, it is a relative measure, and as such countries with vastly differing national coverage can share the same score if the relative distribution is similar. Its use is also limited with bounded variables, such as coverage. Generating an RGI however, which compares the observed GINI coefficient with that expected given existing levels of coverage, helps circumvent the negative correlation that is to be expected when generating GINI coefficients using bounded indicators and allows identification of countries with large relative inequality in provision of WSS. Metrics such as these that accurately align with development principles, including equality of access, are urgently needed. However we would like to add a note of caution: measures of inequality should not be used in isolation, but rather in combination with indicators of absolute coverage. Importantly, equality of use does not reflect how much overall coverage has been achieved, which means that a country could achieve significantly low levels of relative inequality whilst still having very low overall coverage, as clearly demonstrated by Sierra Leone and Ethiopia.Crucially, our results are entirely dependent upon the quality of the water and sanitation data available. DHS, MICs, and LSMS surveys contain a standardised water and sanitation module in which survey questions and response categories are fully harmonised [29], helping to ensure internal consistency and comparability between countries. However, the only available proxy for sustainable access to improved drinking water source and sanitation is self-reported use and ownership. These reports are rarely if ever supplemented by visual inspection to confirm the functionality and whereabouts of the water source, or correct use of the latrine. Whilst many epidemiological studies rely on self-report to measure type and use of such facilities, to our knowledge, very few studies have examined the reliability of self-reported water and sanitation practices and few have used objective measures to assess actual use [60].Our analysis is based on those indicators currently recommended for monitoring the MDG targets, but these indicators are subject to considerable debate [61]. For example, not all water sources that are classified as improved will provide water that is safe to drink [62]. Correction with data on drinking water quality would likely have a large impact on estimates, calling into question whether the MDG water target would actually be met by 2015 [61]. For example, the only nationally representative water quality data that exists for SSA, to our knowledge, suggests that only 72% of improved drinking-water sources in Ethiopia were in compliance with WHO and national guidelines on drinking water quality [63]. There is currently massive lack of capacity in many countries to generate reliable and representative information on drinking water quality [64], and so we are unable to make appropriate corrections. Neither have we been able to account for the reliability of water supplies—studies across SSA have suggested that up to around one-third of hand-pumps may be non-functioning—nor of household treatment of water [65]. Our preliminary analysis of distance to water source however has suggested that only a little over half of all rural households reported as using an improved water source were using one within 30-minutes round trip of their household. This is especially striking given that a recent systematic review and meta-analysis has suggested significant increase in illness risk in people living further away from their water source [66]. Distance is an important determinant of the quantity of water brought to the household and used for drinking, cooking, and hygiene behaviours [65], and given our results we would suggest that future monitoring activities should always attempt to quantify the time taken for households to obtain their water.Similarly controversial is the definition of improved sanitation. For example, a latrine that is correctly used by all members of the household and well maintained can provide an effective barrier to the transmission of faecal-oral disease, whereas a latrine that is not used correctly or that is poorly maintained can actually become a focus for the transmission of disease. Our reported use measures that rely upon the potentially subjective definition of an “improved” pit latrine. Again to avoid approximation, we only include latrines classified as having a slab as improved, which is supported by evidence from Tanzania suggesting the presence of helminth eggs in a large majority (71%) of soil samples collected from more simple pit latrines [67]. Nevertheless, it is not possible to correct for the appropriate use and cleanliness of all latrines classified as improved. Finally, as detailed in Box 1, we have classified all sanitation facilities that use improved technology as improved, regardless of whether they are shared, primarily to avoid approximating when data were unavailable (e.g., all pre-2004 surveys). Although this will include some public sanitation facilities (which may often be used by too many people, be poorly maintained, expensive or distant, and even post a risk for interpersonal violence [68]–[70]), in most instances these represent private facilities shared between five households or fewer. There is little evidence surrounding the health impacts of such facilities [71],[72], but it has been argued that a high proportion are probably safe for health [73]. This will however mean that our estimates of coverage for improved sanitation will be substantially higher than those produced by the JMP, who define all shared facilities as unimproved, preventing them from being directly comparable.The multilevel modelling approach used here is transparent and flexible, offering advantages over the traditional country-specific linear regression models currently employed by the JMP. As demonstrated in a recent similar exploration of multilevel modelling for estimating national access to drinking water and sanitation [46], using a single model for all countries provides a continuous time series, providing additional information for those countries with scarce data. Our spatial Bayesian approach also enables use of information from neighbouring areas to improve predictions in unsampled areas [24], and quantifies the uncertainty resulting from modelling sub-national estimates at small spatial scales. Some limitations should be noted: we still relied on fitting linear time trends whereas a more flexible curve fitting approach might be more appropriate [46]; we did not include further covariates in the model; we did not consider uncertainties associated with the survey estimates arising from non-sampling errors; and we modelled household, not population, use (i.e., for each survey site we modelled the proportion of households reporting use). The latter may systematically bias our estimates upwards, as it is likely that individuals living in smaller (and potentially richer) households with greater access to WSS will be overrepresented. It will also be important to validate this work as new data become available.Although not intended to reproduce the JMP, and not directly comparable for improved sanitation, in most instances our estimates are in keeping with official estimates (improved drinking water: r = 0.77, root mean squared error [rmse] 11.3%; open defecation: r = 0.92, rmse = 7.7%) although they do differ substantially for individual countries, up to 33% for access to an improved drinking-water source and 19% for access to improved sanitation. These differences may be attributed in part to our hierarchical modelling approach—which combines both a more robust handling of temporal trends, and potentially more accurate population weighting as a result of disaggregation. However, the reduced amount of data available for this analysis for many countries (we did not have access to national census data or government surveys) will have played a very important role. For example, the largest difference we see for access to improved drinking water is for Guinea (32%), for which we relied on only two DHS surveys in contrast to the nine surveys and censuses available to JMP.The implications of geographical inequalities in WSS coverage go beyond logistic considerations of effective service provision. Being able to target where inequalities exist will bring us closer to the goal of universal water and sanitation, which will fulfil human rights obligations. Understanding geographic inequities in WSS coverage can also provide insight into the epidemiology and control of many infectious diseases. Access to safe water and improved sanitation significantly reduce not only diarrhoeal disease [74],[75], but also water-borne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and cryptosporidiosis [12], and NTDs such as soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH), schistosomiasis, and trachoma [13]–[16],[76]. In recent years, there has been a concerted effort to develop geographical resources on a range of infectious and tropical diseases [77]–[79] and combining these data with knowledge of local WSS provision and other externalities [18],[80] can provide an empirical basis on which to interpret and predict the impact of public health programmes. For example, there is a large body of evidence that the risk of cholera transmission is greatly reduced as water and sanitation coverage improves [81]–[83], with recent mathematical models suggesting that WSS interventions may be as effective as the oral cholera vaccine in averting cholera cases, with the greatest impacts seen when the two are implemented in combination [84]. Similarly, it is unlikely that drug-based interventions alone will eliminate or control STH, schistosomiasis, and trachoma where WSS coverage remains low [18],[85]–[88]. Whilst growing resolve for collaboration and coordination between the WSS and health sectors is encouraging, there is still a pressing need to build a strong evidence base for collaborative programming [89]. For instance, it has been argued that an historic dissociation of WSS and health sectors has led to major problems in developing and maintaining essential infrastructure [65], and as such the public health community must play a role in setting health-based targets and indicators [51]. An essential component of this is the development of more effective and cross-sectoral coverage and impact indicators [89]. These should be able to effectively measure improvements in both WSS and infection control, and should consider in detail all potential factors that contribute to infection risk.Although reducing inequalities was not a key element of the original health-related MDGs, there is a growing consensus that monitoring indicators solely at national levels fails to incentivise the targeting of areas of greatest need and potential greatest impact [7],[42],[90]. Here, we have revealed substantial levels of inequality in contemporary access to both improved drinking-water supplies and sanitation and open defecation within countries, and have shown how mapping the geographical distribution of WSS at policy relevant scales can help to make visible those deprived subgroups that were previously hidden within national statistics. As a consequence, we would urge the JMP to consider providing sub-national estimates of coverage within its country profiles, coupled with summary statistics of relative inequality. Mapping a phenomenon, however, does not explain it, and reasons for inequalities are likely to vary substantially between countries. Detailed investigation of the influence of contextual and programmatic factors on contemporary coverage, as well as changing patterns of inequality over time, are outside the scope of the present analysis, but are issues we intend to address in future work at both national and regional scales. More generally, this work has highlighted those countries that are struggling to target resources to areas of greatest need, and it is the responsibility of the international community to provide these countries with assistance in the development of strategies and investment plans to reduce inequality and marginalization. Finally, our intention was to create a vital resource for both researchers and planners, and to this end sub-national maps can be viewed on www.ntdmap.org and the data are available on www.thiswormyworld.org."

                "\nSpecies' geographical distributions are tracking latitudinal and elevational surface temperature gradients under global climate change. To evaluate the opportunities to track these gradients across space, we provide a first baseline assessment of the steepness of these gradients for the world's terrestrial birds. Within the breeding ranges of 9,014 bird species, we characterized the spatial gradients in temperature along latitude and elevation for all and a subset of bird species, respectively. We summarized these temperature gradients globally for threatened and non-threatened species and determined how their steepness varied based on species' geography (range size, shape, and orientation) and projected changes in temperature under climate change. Elevational temperature gradients were steepest for species in Africa, western North and South America, and central Asia and shallowest in Australasia, insular IndoMalaya, and the Neotropical lowlands. Latitudinal temperature gradients were steepest for extratropical species, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. Threatened species had shallower elevational gradients whereas latitudinal gradients differed little between threatened and non-threatened species. The strength of elevational gradients was positively correlated with projected changes in temperature. For latitudinal gradients, this relationship only held for extratropical species. The strength of latitudinal gradients was better predicted by species' geography, but primarily for extratropical species. Our findings suggest threatened species are associated with shallower elevational temperature gradients, whereas steep latitudinal gradients are most prevalent outside the tropics where fewer bird species occur year-round. Future modeling and mitigation efforts would benefit from the development of finer grain distributional data to ascertain how these gradients are structured within species' ranges, how and why these gradients vary among species, and the capacity of species to utilize these gradients under climate change.\n"

            "fulltext": "IntroductionA variety of responses are available for species as global climate change progresses [1], [2] and changing climatic conditions increasingly impact species' performance and fitness. The two primary options, which are not necessarily independent, are for species' populations to shift their geographic ranges to regions containing suitable climatic conditions, or to remain and adapt phenotypically or genetically [3], [4]. One of the most important immediate responses is for species to track their geographic climatic associations across space. This may be possible provided that opportunities are available for geographic range-shifts, species have the physiological and behavioral capacity to take advantage of them, and they can keep pace with the velocity of climate change [5]. Geographic niche tracking has been observed under climate change over geological time scales [6] and more recently under modern climate change [7], [8].\nTwo environmental gradients appear particularly relevant when considering geographic niche tracking under past and current climate change: surface latitudinal and elevational temperature gradients. Both gradients represent natural environmental features whose location and general form remain consistent across ecological time-scales, and there is empirical evidence that many taxa including birds are currently tracking these gradients under climate change [7], [9]. Latitudinal temperature gradients are strongest outside the tropics, especially in the Northern Hemisphere where the most extensive land masses are located [10]. Elevational temperature gradients are stronger and less variable than latitudinal temperature gradients but are geographically more restricted [11]. Latitudinal and elevational temperature gradients are not equally available for all species nor are they uniformly distributed within species' geographic ranges. Under current climate change projections, there is no evidence to suggest the strength of elevational temperature gradients are expected to change; whereas there is evidence that the strength of latitudinal temperatures gradients may change over broad geographic regions [2]. Due to latitudinal asymmetry in surface warming, latitudinal temperature gradients are projected to weaken in the Northern Hemisphere [2], [12], which is expected to result in diminished seasonality and increased vegetation growth at the high northern latitudes [13], [14].\nLife history, morphological, and physiological traits are known to vary among species' populations at geographic scales [15] and, in some cases, this variation is correlated with latitudinal or elevational gradients [16], [17] and associated temperature gradients [18]. This variation in ecological traits across latitudinal or elevational gradients can in turn affect reproductive potential and rates of population growth, especially at range limits [19], [20]. Under climate change, the structure of latitudinal and elevational temperature gradients can be modified, affecting population growth rates, especially at the leading and trailing edge of the gradient within species' ranges [21], [22]. Specifically, climate change can result in population growth increasing at the leading edge and declining at the trailing edge of the gradient, with the increased likelihood of range shifts at the leading edge and extirpation of populations at the trailing edge.\nThe strength of latitudinal and elevational temperature gradients within species current geographic ranges relative to projected changes in temperature under climate change can determine the potential for range-shifts to occur under climate change. For species whose geographic ranges have similar spatial dimensions in relationship to latitudinal or elevational temperature gradients, the steeper the gradient, the broader the species' geographic climatic niche (i.e., species' association with climatic conditions across space) and the greater the likelihood that a larger component of current climatic associations will be retained within the geographic range as temperatures increase (Figure 1A,B,C). In contrast, the shallower the gradient, the narrower the species' geographic climatic niche and the smaller the likelihood that a significant geographic component of current climatic conditions will be retained within the geographic range as temperatures increase (Figure 1D,E,F). One potential consequence of shallow latitudinal or elevational temperature gradients is the formation of range-shift gaps [10]. Here, increasing temperatures can result in the complete loss of current climatic associations within species' current geographic ranges, an outcome that may substantially hinder successful range-shifts. Range-shift gap width is also likely to be negatively correlated with the strength of the temperature gradients (Figure 1), suggesting species' distributions containing very weak gradients, as found with many tropical species, are particularly susceptible to the consequences of climate change [10]. In total, climate change can modify latitudinal or elevational temperature gradients within species' geographic ranges, which in turn can alter population dynamics at range boundaries and range-shift potential based on the strength of those gradients relative to the magnitude of climate change.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.  Conceptual figures of six geographic range-shift scenarios for species containing steep (A,B,C) or shallow (D,E,F) latitudinal or elevational temperature gradients within their geographic ranges.The spatial breadth of the latitudinal or elevational gradient within the geographic range is identical in each case. The current temperature gradient (solid line) and the projected temperature gradient under climate change (dashed line) are shown for each scenario. The location of the geographic range of the species along the temperature gradient is depicted with a bold line between the solid blue and red arrows. The species' leading (blue arrow) and trailing (red arrow) range limits are shown based on the current gradient (solid arrows) and the projected gradient under climate change (dashed arrows). Three gradations in projected climate change are shown: weak (A, D), moderate (B, E), and strong climate change (C, F). The horizontal dotted lines identify the boundaries of each species' geographic climatic niche as defined along the temperature gradient. Everything else being equal, species with steeper environmental temperature gradients have broader geographic climatic niches and need to shift their geographic range less in order to track climate change.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0098361.g001Here, we estimate latitudinal and elevational temperature gradients within the geographic ranges of ca. 90% of the world's avifauna, numbering 9,014 species. To evaluate whether bird species that are currently threatened with extinction also face particularly high risks under climate change, we structure our analysis to compare species classified as threatened (n = 878) vs. non-threatened with extinction (n = 8,136) on the IUCN Red List [23]. We additionally examine the ability of species' geography (range size, shape, and orientation relative to the equator) to explain variation in elevational and latitudinal temperature gradients among species. These characteristics of species' ranges tend to be geographically similar across taxa [24] and are determined in part by spatial variation in climate and topography [25]. Lastly, to assess the degree of correspondence between projected warming and the availability of elevational and latitudinal temperature gradients within species' ranges, we consider how gradient strength is related to variation in projected changes in temperature under climate change.\nMaterials and Methods\nData sources and preparation\nWe acquired range maps for the world's birds from BirdLife International and NatureServe [26] whose data sources are described in Buchanan, Donald and Butchart [27]. We considered breeding/resident ranges only and excluded species that were not well suited for our analysis, specifically those associated with marine environments. This resulted in a total of 9,014 extant species for analysis (see Table S1). These species were classified as either threatened (n = 878) or non-threatened with extinction (n = 8,136) using the IUCN Red List [23]. Here threatened refers to species identified as vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered under the IUCN Red List.\nSpecies range data was analyzed using a gridded system having a cylindrical equal-area projection and a cell area of 3,091 km2. We defined species' geographic breeding ranges as the spatial combination of equal area cells with ≥50% terrestrial surface area (based on the proportion of the cell that contained non-marine terrain) that intersected each species' geographic range polygon. We placed each species into one of six biogeographical realms [28] based on the realm that contained the greatest proportion of each species' gridded range (Nearctic, Palaearctic, IndoMalaya, Neotropics, Afrotropics, and Australasia). Species whose ranges occurred primarily in Antarctica or Oceania were excluded from analysis. From the 9,014 species, we acquired minimum and maximum elevation associations for 4,978 species from BirdLife International [23]. The distribution of these species across the six realms did not show geographic biases, with the proportion of species in each realm not diverging significantly from expectation (χ2 = 0.029, df = 5, P = 1.0).\nTemperatures within species' geographic ranges were estimated using the annual average of 1950–2000 average-monthly temperatures from WorldClim [29] gridded and analyzed at a 30-arcsec resolution (ca. 1 km at the equator). Elevations within species' ranges were estimated using the USGS global digital elevation model (GTOPO30) gridded and analyzed at a 30-arcsec resolution. Tropospheric lapse rates, the association between temperature and elevation within the troposphere, were estimated globally using a gridded model at a resolution of 2.5° (ca. 278 km at the equator) for the period 1948–2001 [11].\nBroad-scale, expert-based range maps are only coarsely defined estimates of species occurrence and reliably characterize presences only above 100 km grain [30], [31]. Here, we are interested in the form of latitudinal and elevational temperature gradients (i.e., shallow or steep) as defined across the geographic breadth of species' distributions independent of patterns of occurrence. The use of relatively high resolution global estimates of temperature and elevation provided the detail of data necessary to estimate the full structure of these gradients for individual species, especially in situations where geographic ranges were small or temperature gradients were non-linear. For the purpose of this baseline study we assume that low probability of occurrence naturally incurred at the finer spatial grain are not biasing the geographic and species comparisons. We acknowledge that this assumption is not necessarily valid and will require careful follow-up assessments at local scales or at broader scales once more detailed distribution data becomes available.\nProjected changes in temperature (temperature anomalies) were estimated using projections averaged over four Atmosphere Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs). The four AOGCMs were CNRMCM3, CSIRO-Mk3.0, ECHam5, and MIROC 3.2. The gridded projections from these models were downscaled to 30 arc-minute resolution using pattern scaling with the MarkSim weather generator [32]. The projections were based on the A2 scenario, which is currently considered to be the most relevant under current greenhouse gas emission rates [33], [34]. The anomalies represent the change in temperature between the twentieth century control 30-year normal (1961–1990) and the 30-year period 2081–2100. The temperature anomalies were bilinearly interpolated to match the resolution of the 3,091 km2 equal-area grid.\n\n\nElevational temperature gradients\nWe estimated latitudinal and elevational temperature gradients separately in order to better represent each gradient's unique characteristics. The presence of elevational temperature gradients is dictated by the presence of mountain systems or orographic features, which show substantial geographic variation (see Figure S1). Mountain systems often contain strong topographic heterogeneity resulting in a mosaic of climatic conditions, which are poorly estimated using interpolated weather station data [35], [36]. Here, we use elevation data, which does not rely on similar interpolation methods, to estimate elevational temperature gradients within species' ranges.\nUnlike latitudinal temperature gradients, the strength of elevational temperature gradients are broadly consistent from the equator to the poles. Tropospheric lapse-rate averages 6.2°C km−1 over the continents, with a range of 4.5 to 6.5°C km−1 from the polar latitudes to the equator, respectively [11]. To account for this geographic variation, we calculated the average tropospheric lapse-rate within each species' geographic range. To account for the high variability in the extent and spatial distribution of orographic features and the decline in terrestrial area with increasing elevation resulting in strongly skewed distributions of elevation within species' ranges, we estimated two components of the elevational temperature gradient for each species: (1) the overall magnitude and (2) the evenness of the gradient. We then combined tropospheric lapse-rate with magnitude and evenness to generate one metric designed to represent the overall strength of elevational temperature gradients within each species' range.\nMore specifically, for species whose minimum and maximum elevation associations had both been estimated (n = 4,978), we excluded elevations within the geographic range below and above these associations. We then identified the actual minimum and maximum elevations within each species' range based on our gridded elevation data, which in combination with species' documented elevation associations were used to calculate each species' realized vertical range extent. Vertical range extent was used to estimate the magnitude of each species' elevational temperature gradient. To assess how evenly the vertical range extent was distributed across each species' range, we first summed the number of 30 arc-second elevation cells in all 100-m elevational bands found within each species range. We then used the Lorenz curve and associated Gini coefficient [37]–[39], explained below, to estimate how evenly the cells were distributed across elevation bands. Here, the 100-m bands were first ranked from lowest to highest elevation. The frequency of cells within these bands was then used to plot the Lorenz curve, i.e. the cumulative proportion of the number of cells in each band (x-axis) against the corresponding cumulative proportion of their elevations (y-axis). Gini coefficients (or Gini ratio) were then calculated, which is defined as twice the area contained between the Lorenz curve and the line of perfect equality (or perfect evenness). The Gini coefficient has a range from 0 to 1, high to low evenness, respectively. To ease interpretation, for each species we took the product of the vertical range extent, average tropospheric lapse rate, and the inverse of evenness (1 – Gini coefficient) to generate a single index for the elevational temperature gradient. We interpret this index as the overall strength of the elevational temperature gradient across each species' range: larger values indicate the presence of a strong and more evenly distributed gradient; lower values indicate the presence of a weak gradient due to either a small vertical range extent or an unevenly distributed vertical range extent.\n\n\nLatitudinal temperature gradients\nOutside the tropics, average annual temperature declines on average 0.7°C for each degree of latitude in the Northern Hemisphere and on average 0.5°C for each degree of latitude in the Southern Hemisphere (Figure S2). With one degree of latitude equal to approximately 111 km, this translates to a decline of 1°C for every 150 km in the Northern Hemisphere and a decline of 1°C for every 197 km in the Southern Hemisphere.\nWe estimated the latitudinal temperature gradient within the breeding ranges of 9,014 species while controlling for variation in elevation. For our approach, we first found the average tropospheric lapse rate within each species' range. We then compiled gridded 30 arc-second average annual temperatures and elevations within each species' range. We chose annual average temperature because matching each species' breeding season distribution with their unique breeding season temperatures, especially for migratory species that only spend a few weeks to months on the breeding grounds, was not feasible. A likely consequence of using annual average temperature is that estimates of latitudinal temperature gradients for species that breed outside the tropics are likely to be steeper than they would be if estimates were based on the breeding season alone. Beyond these qualitative differences, using annual average temperature is unlikely to alter our qualitative conclusions. To control for the effect of elevation on temperature, we applied quantile regression to temperature as a function of elevation for 11 quantiles (0.0, 0.1,…0.9, 1.0). The residuals for the quantile whose slope most closely matched the tropospheric lapse rate estimated for each species was retained for further analysis. This approach allowed us to interpret latitudinal temperature gradients as the gradient along a fixed elevation within each species' range.\nThe relationship between these residuals and latitude was then assessed for each species using segmented linear regression [40]. If species' ranges occurred in both hemispheres, the range was first split in half at the equator and each portion was analyzed separately. We tested if the relationship between temperature and latitude contained one or two segments using Davie's test [41], which tests for a non-zero difference in the slope parameters of the segmented relationship. Relationships with two segments are more likely to occur if species' distributions are intersected by the Tropics of Cancer or Capricorn (Figure S2). When there was statistical evidence for a segmented relationship, we estimated a break point between segments and slope coefficients for each segment. When there was no statistical evidence for multiple segments, a single slope coefficient was estimated. Coefficients estimated south of the equator were multiplied by −1 to allow for comparison between the two hemispheres (i.e., latitudinal temperature gradients north and south of the equator are both negative; Figure S2). For species whose ranges were estimated by one slope coefficient, this coefficient was used to represent the overall gradient. For species whose ranges contained multiple slope coefficients, we used a weighted average to summarize the gradient. Weights were based on the latitudinal extent of the region where each slope coefficient was estimated. Based on this procedure, larger negative values indicate steeper latitudinal temperature gradients and values approaching zero indicate shallower latitudinal temperature gradients.\n\n\nAnalysis\nTo summarize how steep elevational and latitudinal temperature gradients are on average within species' ranges globally, we first calculated the average elevational temperature gradient and median latitudinal temperature gradient within each equal-area cell for all species whose geographic ranges intersected that cell. To summarize how gradients differed for threatened and non-threatened species, we quantified how the gradients varied by species' median latitude. This analysis was implemented separately for species in each of the six biogeographical realms. For elevational temperature gradients, we used generalized additive models (GAM; [42]) with a Gaussian error distribution. For latitudinal temperature gradients, we used robust MM-type polynomial regression [43], [44]. GAM was selected because it adjusts automatically to the nonlinear associations observed between elevational temperature gradients and species' median latitude. This feature also supported the use of GAM to examine how species richness, range size, elevational extent, and Gini coefficient varied by species' median latitude for threatened and non-threatened species. Robust polynomial regression was selected for latitudinal temperature gradients because of the presence of many extreme outliers that were poorly modeled with GAM. In addition, the general curvilinear form of the relationship was well represented with a polynomial function. The order of the polynomial function was determined using robust Wald-type or deviance-type tests of nested model pairs. Median latitude was defined as the median of the full latitudinal extent of each species' range.\nWe used robust multiple regression to examine the ability of geographic and climatic predictors to explain the variability observed in species latitudinal and elevational temperature gradients. The four predictors were estimated within each species' geographic range and included average projected temperature anomaly, and geographic range size, shape, and orientation. Range size was log10 transformed before analysis. Range shape and orientation were estimated based on a principle component analysis (PCA) of the latitude and longitude of the grid cells contained within each species geographic range. PCA was conducted using a singular value decomposition of the centered data matrix. The square roots of the two eigenvalues were used to estimate range shape, where the minimum eigenvalue was divided by the maximum eigenvalue. Here, values approaching zero indicating elongated ranges and values approaching one indicating circular ranges. Range orientation was estimated based on the angle of the major axis of the PCA eigenvector from the equator. Values for range orientation were defined from 0° (parallel with the equator) to 90° (perpendicular to the equator). We evaluated our four predictors for multi-collinearity and singularity using variance inflation factors (VIFs) where predictors with VIF>5 indicate cause for concern and VIF>10 indicate the presence of significant collinearity [45]. We retained all four predictors after they were deemed to be statistically independent (VIF≤1.6).\nTo evaluate differences between threatened and non-threatened species, we included in addition to the four continuous predictors, a species' IUCN Red List status as threatened or non-threatened with extinction. For the analysis of the latitudinal temperature gradient, we also considered if the median latitude of a species' range was located within or outside the tropics. Median latitudes between 23.5°S and 23.5°N latitude were considered tropical. The tropical/extratropical classification was included because it defined a major feature of the gradient (Figure S2). In total, we examined eight robust multiple regression models that consisted of the two gradients, the four continuous predictors, associated categorical predictors, and all pairwise interactions.\nAll analyses were conducted in R version 3.0.1 [46]. Segmented regression was conducted using the ‘segmented’ library, robust regression using the ‘robust’ and ‘robustbase’ libraries, and GAM using the ‘mgcv’ library [42]. We used the default optimization procedure to estimate the degree of smoothing in the GAMs [42]. The Lorenz curves were estimated using the ‘ineq’ library and the Gini coefficients were estimated using the ‘reldist’ library.\n\nResultsThreatened and non-threatened bird species presented similar latitudinal trends in species richness with peaks for both groups occurring in the tropics (Figure 2A and Figure S3). Range sizes for threatened species were significantly smaller on average except for species located at the most extreme northern and southern latitudes (Figure 2B and Figure S3). For the 4,978 species with documented elevational associations, threatened species had smaller vertical range extents within their geographic ranges (Figure 2C and Figure S3) and threatened species had higher elevational evenness within their geographic ranges in the central tropics and more equivalent elevational evenness elsewhere (Figure 2D and Figure S3). Projected increases in temperature within species' ranges were highest for species located at higher latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere and lowest for species located at lower latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere (Figure S4).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 2.

When considering the combined effects of elevational extent and elevational evenness (Figure S3) with tropospheric lapse rate, the strongest gradients were found for species located in Africa, the western part of North and South America, and the Tibetan Plateau region. In contrast, species in Australasia, the islands of IndoMalaya and the lowlands of the Neotropics had the weakest elevational temperature gradients (Figure 3). Threatened species were associated with weaker elevational temperature gradients across the six biogeographical realms, with the most significant differences occurring in the Neotropics and Afrotropics (Figure 3).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 3.

The steepest latitudinal temperature gradients occurred in the Northern Hemisphere. Australasia had the strongest gradients in the Southern Hemisphere, which did not match the strength observed in the Northern Hemisphere. There was no evidence that the latitudinal temperature gradients differed between threatened and non-threatened species across the six biogeographical realms (Figure 4).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 4.

Species with higher projected temperature increases and larger geographic ranges had steeper elevational temperature gradients, and this was the case for both threatened and non-threatened species. Species with geographic ranges that were elongated in shape and oriented perpendicular to the equator had stronger gradients, and this was more pronounced for non-threatened species.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 1.

Tropical species had weaker relationships for all four predictors with little evidence for differences between threatened and non-threatened species. For threatened and non-threatened extratropical species, species with higher projected temperature increases, larger ranges and ranges that were elongated in shape and oriented parallel with the equator had steeper latitudinal temperature gradients. For threatened extratropical species, gradients were even steeper for species with larger ranges.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 2.  Coefficients and test statistics from robust linear models examining predictors of latitudinal temperature gradients as estimated within the geographic ranges of 9,014 bird species.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0098361.t002Species face unique challenges under climate change, with the availability and strength of range-shift opportunities along latitudinal or elevational temperature gradients playing a significant role in determining species' likelihood of persistence. In this study we provide the first estimation of these gradients for the world's avifauna relative to species' IUCN Red List category, geography, and projected exposure to climate change. Our approach expands upon current methods for estimating species' geographic climatic associations by measuring these two gradients individually using fine-grained environmental data, which more accurately captures their unique spatial structures. The application of this approach has the potential to increase biological realism and predictive quality in current large-scale modeling efforts by removing problematic assumptions and minimizing potential biases. Our findings suggest threatened species are at a distinct disadvantage globally based on their association with shallower elevational temperature gradients. Latitudinal temperature gradients are primarily relevant for species located outside the tropics, a region where few bird species occur year-round, including threatened species whose associations with latitudinal temperature gradients did not differ from non-threatened species. Our results also indicate a degree of correspondence between range-shift opportunities and climate change, in that species in regions that are projected to experience greater warming are more likely to be associated with steeper temperature gradients.The strength of latitudinal temperature gradients is determined in part by the location, size, shape and orientation of species' geographic ranges. Not surprisingly, the strongest latitudinal temperature gradients were associated with species whose ranges occurred outside the tropics, especially at the higher latitudes in the North Hemisphere where the largest land masses are located. Species in these regions tend to have larger geographic ranges (see Figure 2B) and ranges that tend to be elongated parallel to the equator. As our results indicate, the strength of the latitudinal temperature gradient is of sufficient size within this region that geographic ranges with narrow latitudinal extents are still able to capture a significant gradient. In contrast, the spatial distribution of elevation temperature gradients reflects the form and extent of orographic features and how species' distributions intersect these features. We found that the strength of these gradients varied substantially across the globe and, unlike latitudinal temperature gradients, differed significantly between threatened and non-threatened species. In agreement with other studies [47], [48], species in Australia and the Islands of IndoMalaya stood out as particularly vulnerable, with some of the shallowest elevational gradients, followed by species located in the lowlands of the Neotropics. In contrast to latitudinal gradients, our ability to predict species' elevational temperature gradients was limited, reflecting the greater geographic heterogeneity in the location and structure of these gradients.The strength of both temperature gradients was positively correlated with projected changes in temperature, but only for species outside the tropics with latitudinal temperature gradients. The greatest increases in temperature under climate change are projected to occur at the high northern latitudes (see Figure S4). Our findings therefore suggest a geographic correspondence with the greatest projected warming occurring in regions with the strongest latitudinal temperature gradients. However, few bird species occur at the high northern latitudes year round. The proportion of migratory species (ca. 19% of extant bird species [49]) within breeding communities increasing linearly as you travel north from the equator, approaching 100% at the highest latitudes [50]. Migratory species spend the bulk of their annual cycle in migration or on the non-breeding ranges at lower latitudes. Thus, very few bird species are likely to benefit substantially from this correspondence.IUCN Red List categories of extinction risk are assigned using the Red List criteria, which have quantitative thresholds relating to population and range size, structure and trends [23]. Only 3.5% of threatened or near threatened bird species (77/2193) are assessed as threatened by climate change so severely that the global population may be declining rapidly or very rapidly over three generations, and hence potentially contributing to their Red List category through the A criterion. Of these, only 26 (1.2%) actually qualify under the A criterion. Our findings suggest this proportion is likely to increase, especially for threatened species associated with shallow elevational temperature gradients. As confirmed in our analysis, threatened species occur primarily in the tropics and their distributions are defined by smaller geographic ranges and elevational extents. Hence, threatened species may be at a geographic disadvantage under climate change with limited associations with elevational or latitudinal temperature gradients, although we found no evidence for the latter. Our findings suggest threatened species that occur in the central tropics have higher elevational evenness across their range, which is a likely consequence of their distributions occurring on steep montane slopes outside of lowland areas, which should result in stronger elevational temperature gradients for these species. However, our analysis suggests that the differences in elevational evenness between threatened and non-threatened species was not substantial enough to overcome the smaller elevational extents contained within threatened species' geographic ranges. Thus, our findings suggest the weaker elevational temperature gradients identified for threatened species is due in large part to a consistent association with smaller elevational extents within their ranges.When considering both gradients in combination, two regions stand out as having both strong elevational and latitudinal temperature gradients: western North America and Central Asia (see Figures 3–4). These results suggest species in these regions will have greater opportunities to track their climatic niches geographically. Depending on how these temperature gradients intersect spatially within species' ranges, some combination of these gradients could be used. Similarly, two regions stand out as having both shallow elevational and latitudinal temperature gradients: the islands of IndoMalaya and the Amazon Basin in South America (see Figures 3–4). Species in these regions are likely to develop substantial range-shift gaps under climate change [10], resulting in limited opportunities to track their climatic niche geographically. Bird species occurring in the Amazon Basin are also considered to have low adaptive capacity, which may increase their vulnerability to climate change [51].Species in tropical montane regions are more likely to have restricted lateral and vertical distributions [48], [52] and are also more likely to be threatened with extinction (see Figure S3). Even though in many cases these species occur in some of the most extensive montane systems in the world, our findings suggest that the overall steepness of elevational gradients is constrained by their limited representation within species' geographic ranges. Local climatic heterogeneity, however, may allow for microclimatic adjustments that could compensate for broader climatic trends [53]–[56]. The level of climatic heterogeneity is determined by local topographic variation and also by species' habitat associations [57]. For example, species in forested habitats may have greater opportunities for microclimatic adjustments relative to species in open habitats [58]. In general, however, behavior resulting in microclimatic adjustments might not be sufficient to address the full consequences of climate change [59].Even if latitudinal and elevational temperature gradients are readily available, dispersal along these gradients is not guaranteed. Dispersal abilities are determined in large part by species' morphological, physiological and behavioral characteristics and adaptations [60], [61], all of which are likely to be altered under rapid climate change [62]. Dispersal under climate change may be constrained by unsuitable habitat, population or habitat fragmentation [58], [63], or interspecific competition [64]. In addition, gene flow that occurs in association with dispersal can both support and hinder range-shift potential [65]. Gene flow among populations at the leading edge of the range has been found to benefit fitness, whereas gene flow from the interior to the leading edge has been identified as maladaptive [66], [67]. Dispersal abilities also vary tremendously among species and between taxa [60]. Even highly vagile taxa such as birds do not necessarily have the full complement of behavioral or physiological characteristics needed to support successful dispersal, which is considered particularly relevant for tropical species [68], [69]. Although there is evidence tropical montane birds have moved upslope under climate change [70], the low annual variation in temperatures within the tropics relative to temperate regions may result in stronger physiological barriers to dispersal for tropical species [52], [71], [72]. When tropical habitats are fragmented through human activities – a process that is occurring at an increasing rate – dispersal can become even more constrained [73], [74]. If species' responses are hindered by dispersal limitations or interspecific competition, as is expected for many tropical montane bird communities, substantial ecological disruptions are likely to occur [75].In contrast, species that breed outside the tropics that are also migratory [76] or have larger geographic ranges tend to have stronger natal dispersal abilities [77]–[79]. Thus migratory species that are broadly distributed and breed outside the tropics might be in a better position to track elevational or latitudinal temperature gradients. However, exceptions exist [80] and factors that are strongly correlated with dispersal abilities might not be similarly correlated with broad-scale distributional responses under climate change [81]. Nevertheless, current evidence indicates distributional responses for birds along latitudinal [7] and elevational temperature gradients [82] are lagging behind warming trends, suggesting stronger responses could develop as climate change progresses and time lags are overcome [7].We estimated temperature gradients in this study using relatively high resolution environmental data that was finer than the resolution of the species' range data [30]. This grain mismatch resulted in temperature gradients likely being estimated over fine-grain sections of species' ranges where probability of occurrence is low. Our main results focus on the geographic form of the gradient across the spatial breadth of species' distributions, but future work will benefit from further examination of potential biases this grain mismatch may have on comparisons. How patterns of occurrence are structured within species' ranges, based on proportion of occupancy and level of aggregation [83], may affect the chances of successful dispersal along these gradients. For example, sparse or fragmented patterns of occurrence may diminish the chances of successful dispersal, while more continuous patterns of occurrence may improve them. Alternatively, large contiguous regions with low probabilities of occurrence might contain the steepest gradients with very little dispersal value, as when lowland species' distributions border mountain systems. These remaining uncertainties highlight the need for advancing the spatial grain of our global biodiversity knowledge and for the necessary collaborative data mobilization, integration and quality control to realize this [31].In addition to temperature, other climate factors and conditions are likely to be important in determining the strength and importance of latitudinal and elevation temperature gradients in defining range-shift potential. Two that have received particular attention are changes in precipitation regimes and changes in climatic variability. In contrast to temperature, precipitation has more complex spatial and temporal variability and more complex associations with latitudinal and elevational gradients. Projected changes in precipitation are also more ambiguous [2], which adds uncertainty to current estimates on how species are likely to respond to climate change [84]. A second factor is climatic variability, which is projected to increase through an increased frequency of extreme climate events [2]. Temporal climatic variability is considered an important factor defining species' distributions limits [85] and increasing climatic variability can have varied effects on species' populations [86] including the potential to hinder range shifts [87] and, especially under rapid climate change, increase extinction risk [88].Additional research is needed to improve our understanding of how latitudinal and especially elevational temperature gradients are structured within species' ranges and the ability of species, especially tropical, to take advantage of these gradients. In particular, studies using higher resolution climate data (e.g., [22]) for species with varying spatial patterns of occurrence and forms of elevational or latitudinal gradients would be informative. Birds are often used as a model biological system due to high data availability, but less vagile taxa also need to be considered such as plants or vertebrate ectotherms that have alternative modes of dispersal and different physiological and behavior capacities. With birds, examining how these gradients are structured within non-breeding ranges, where migratory birds tend to occur during the majority of the annual cycle and are typically less well studied, would be beneficial [9]. Efforts to better understand the role of precipitation and climate variability in defining range-shift potential along latitudinal and elevational temperature gradients would support more comprehensive inferences.Current efforts to project species' distributions or to estimate movement corridors under climate change often assume perfect and complete dispersal along temperature gradients (e.g., [89]). Temperature gradients are typically estimated using coarse-grained interpolated weather-station data based on current climatic conditions where the contrasting spatial forms of latitudinal and especially elevational temperature gradients are often poorly summarized [35], [36]. These methods may exaggerate estimated dispersal distances [90], especially at high northern latitudes where latitudinal temperature gradients are projected to weaken under climate change [12]. These considerations in addition to the correlative nature of these models have promoted the development of more mechanistic or process-based methods intended to improve biological realism and minimize bias in current projections [91]. Our findings suggest the quality of model predictions may be improved by considering the spatial form and strength of species' demographic responses [92] to projected latitudinal and elevational temperature gradients within species' ranges and along possible movement corridorsLastly, in order to maximize range-shift potential under climate change, conservation efforts are needed to maximize the size of areas of contiguous habitat, minimize the extent of habitat fragmentation and promote the permeability of the matrix of habitats around key sites. In particular, efforts to assess and promote connectivity at broad geographic extents are likely to be the most beneficial (e.g., [93], [94]) where existing gradients are represented as continuously as possible across space [95]. The more thoroughly this can be achieved, the greater the potential for species to track changing climatic conditions based on their unique dispersal abilities and ecological and environmental requirements."
