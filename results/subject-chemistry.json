            "fulltext": "IntroductionThe advantages of using the antimicrobial properties of peracetic acid increasingly have been recognized and are gaining usage in a number of industries including the treatment of wastewater [1], usage in hospitals, medical clinics and pharmacies [2], [3], dental practices [4], aquaculture [5], the dairy industry [6] and food preparation [7], such as seeds and sprouts [8], fruits and vegetables [9] and poultry and other fowl [10]. Additionally, other properties of peracetic acid have found use in other industries, such as in the treatment of bioenergy crops [11] where it is used to remove difficult to digest components and in the bleaching of paper products [12]. As the usage of peracetic acid gains greater acceptance, the need for accurate and higher throughput methods to quantitate the concentration of peracetic acid are required.\nPeracetic acid is commercially available in many different concentrations and mixtures, however nearly all peracetic acid preparations contain hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is often a reactant used in the synthesis of peracetic acid and can also be a byproduct of peracetic acid degradation. As these two different peroxides have different chemical properties and biological effects, the concentration of both the peracetic acid and the hydrogen peroxide often must be determined. Classically, peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide have been determined using reduction/oxidation titrations followed by the formation of iodine from iodide [13]. In the 100 years since this initial work was performed, many other methods have been developed to specifically quantitate peracetic acid.\nMethods for the separation, derivatization and detection of these peroxides, such as gas chromatography [14], [15], [16] and HPLC [17], [18], [19] have been developed. While these chromatographic methods are able to quantitate both peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide, like nearly all chromatographic methods, large numbers of solutions cannot be rapidly processed. In addition to these methods, potentiometric and amperometric methods have also been developed [20], [21], [22], [23]. However, most of the electrical signal based methods can only determine peracetic acid and not hydrogen peroxide; have limits in sensitivity, dynamic range or specificity; may require frequent calibrations and require specialized or custom made materials. Optical cuvette based methods employing enzymes such as catalase also have been developed [24]. However, these methods rely on enzyme kinetics and involve continuously measuring the sample until a short lived absorbance minimum is reached.\nAdditionally, one of the main challenges for an accurate measurement using these techniques is the creation of a standard curve from known materials. While pure hydrogen peroxide can be readily obtained, pure distilled peracetic acid is highly reactive and can be difficult to safely produce. The breakdown of both these peroxides, especially the peracetic acid can also cause difficulties in maintaining accurate calibration curves. Even if these issues could be overcome, none of the methods listed above can rapidly quantitate both peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide concentrations in many different samples in a short period of time.\nCurrently, the greatest throughput microtiter plate based method that has been developed utilizes the reaction between peracetic acid and 2,2A-Azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulfonate [25]. While this method does allow for the rapid determination of peracetic acid, it does not quantitate the levels of hydrogen peroxide. Even with all of these methods and their improvements, titrations are still the most widely regarded and commonly utilized industrial method to quantitate peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide concentrations [25]. Clearly there is a need for a rapid and higher throughput method to accurately determine the concentration of peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide in solution. In an effort to develop such a rapid and higher throughput method, the chemistry relied upon in the peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide titrations were explored and modified to create a microtiter plate based absorbance method.\nMaterials and Methods\nMaterials\nCerium (III) sulfate, cerium (IV) sulfate, 0.5 M iodine solution, potassium iodide, sodium hydroxide, 0.1 M sodium thiosulfate solution, 98% sulfuric acid, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid/hydrogen peroxide mixture and starch solution were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Ferroin indicator was purchased from Taylor Technolgies (Sparks, MD). Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) was purchased from Mediatech (Manassas, VA). SpectraMax 384Plus absorbance plate reader was purchased from Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA). Flat bottom 96-well polystyrene plates (Corning #3598), 50 mL polypropylene tubes (BD #352098), 15 mL polypropylene tubes (BD #352099) and all other materials were purchased from VWR (Atlanta, GA). TableCurve2D was purchased from Systat Software (San Jose, CA).\n\n\nAbsorbance spectra\n200 µL of various concentrations of the compounds were added in quadruplicate to the wells of a Corning 96-well flat-bottom plate. The absorbance was read between 300 and 900 nm every 2 nm on a Molecular Devices SpectraMax 384Plus. The average absorbance from a DI water blank was subtracted to yield the final absorbance curve.\n\n\nCerium (IV) standard curve\n100 µL of a 10 to 100,000 µM solution of cerium (IV) sulfate in 10% (v/v) sulfuric acid/water was added in quadruplicate to the wells of a 96-well plate. 100 µL of deionized water was added to each well containing the cerium (IV) sulfate solution. 200 µL of deionized water was added to wells to serve as a blank. The absorbance of the plate was read at 300 to 500 nm every 25 nm. The values of the blank wells were subtracted and the linear range then was determined for each wavelength.\n\n\nIodine standard curve\n100 µL of a 10 to 100,000 µM solution of iodine was added in quadruplicate to the wells of a 96-well plate. 50 µL of deionized water followed by 50 µL of a 3% (v/v) sulfuric acid/water solution were added to each well containing the iodine solution. 200 µL of deionized water was added to wells to serve as a blank. The absorbance of the plate was read at 300 to 600 nm every 25 nm. The values of the blank wells were subtracted and the linear range then was determined for each wavelength.\n\n\nPeracetic acid/hydrogen peroxide determination via titration\nA volume of peracetic acid/hydrogen peroxide was weighed in a 250 mL beaker. 50 mL of a 1 M ice-cooled sulfuric acid/water solution was added to the beaker and the beaker was placed on ice. 3 drops of ferroin indicator were added and the solution was titrated with various concentrations of cerium (IV) sulfate until the disappearance of the salmon color and the appearance of a light blue color. 10 mL of a 2.5 M potassium iodide solution was added to form a dark brownish-red color. The solution was then titrated with various concentrations of sodium thiosulfate. When the solution lightened to a brown-yellow, 1 mL of starch solution was added to produce a dark purple color. Additional sodium thiosulfate was added until the solution turned a salmon color. The volumes and molarity of the cerium (IV) sulfate and sodium thiosulfate were used to calculate the concentration of hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid respectively.\n\n\nHydrogen peroxide determination via microtiter plate based method\n100 µL of a sample solution was added to the wells of a 96-well plate. 200 µL of deionized water was added to wells to serve as a blank. 100 µL of a 10 or 100 mM solution of cerium (IV) sulfate in 10% (v/v) sulfuric acid/water was added to each sample well and the absorbance of the plate immediately was read at 300, 400 and 450 nm. The DI water blank's absorbance was subtracted from the sample's absorbance and concentration of remaining cerium (IV) sulfate was then determined using the standard curve generated as described above. The amount of cerium (IV) sulfate consumed in the reaction was calculated, which is equivalent to twice the amount of hydrogen peroxide present in the sample.\n\n\nTotal peroxide determination via microtiter plate based method\n100 µL of a sample solution was added to the wells of a 96-well plate. 200 µL of deionized water was added to wells to serve as a blank. 50 µL of a 3% (v/v) sulfuric acid/water solution were added to each well containing the iodine solution. 50 µL of a 250 mM potassium iodide solution was added to each sample well. The absorbance was read immediately at 350, 450 and 550 nm. The DI water blank's absorbance was subtracted from the sample's absorbance and the concentration of iodine formed was determined using the standard curves generated as described above. The amount of iodine formed is equivalent to the amount of total peroxide present in the sample. The concentration of peracetic acid can be calculated by subtracting the concentration of hydrogen peroxide from the amount of total peroxide present in the sample.\n\n\nEffect of sulfuric acid concentration on total peroxide determination\n100 µL of a 15 mM total peroxide solution or 100 µL DI water was added to the wells of a 96-well plate. 200 µL of deionized water was added to wells to serve as a blank. 50 µL of various concentrations of sulfuric acid were added to each well, except the blank wells. 50 µL of a 250 mM potassium iodide solution was added to each well, except the blank wells. The absorbance was read at 550 nm every minute for 60 minutes. The DI water blank's absorbance was subtracted from all other absorbance values. The concentration of iodine formed was determined using the standard curve generated as described above.\n\n\nPeracetic acid/hydrogen peroxide degradation\nA commercially available preparation of peracetic acid/hydrogen peroxide in acetic acid was diluted in PBS to yield a final concentration of ~150 mM peracetic acid and ~45 mM hydrogen peroxide. Sodium hydroxide was added until the pH reached 7.5. Various volumes of solution were sampled at various times and the concentrations of peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide were determined via titration as described above. Additionally, 100 µL of sample was added in quadruplicate to the wells of two 96-well plates and the amount of hydrogen peroxide or total peroxides were determined as described above.\n\nResults and Discussion\nIdentification of quantifiable chemical reaction species\nTo create an assay amenable for the rapid determination of both peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide in numerous mixed solutions, a microtiter plate based spectral method was desired. To create such a method, the reactions utilized in various published titration methods were explored. In the modified titration protocol of Greenspan and MacKeller [26], cerium (IV) sulfate is reacted specifically with hydrogen peroxide followed by the addition of potassium iodide which is converted into iodine by the remaining peracetic acid.\nIn order to determine if the reactants and/or products could be directly observed without the use of indicator solutions, such as the ferroin and starch solutions utilized in the titration, the absorbance spectra of cerium (III) sulfate, cerium (IV) sulfate, potassium iodide, iodine, sulfuric acid and peracetic acid/hydrogen peroxide solution were measured (see Figures S1 through S6). Most of these chemicals are clear or white and unsurprisingly did not have any significant absorption in the visible spectrum. However, the cerium (IV) sulfate and iodine did exhibit strong absorption in the blue region, giving rise to their yellow color. Unfortunately, since both of these chemical species absorb similar wavelengths of light, they could not be quantitated together in a single reaction mixture. Therefore, a two reaction strategy was employed to determine the concentration of both peroxides.\n\n\nSelective Hydrogen Peroxide Quantitation\nAs shown in Figure 1A and B, the reaction of the colored cerium (IV) sulfate to the colorless cerium (III) sulfate proceeds in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, but not in the presence of peracetic acid. The selectivity of this reaction can therefore be used to specifically quantitate the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in solution. To accomplish this, a standard curve of cerium (IV) sulfate was established. First, 100 µL of various concentrations of cerium (IV) sulfate and 100 µL of DI water were added to the wells of a 96-well plate. The absorbance of cerium (IV) sulfate can be measured at multiple wavelengths depending upon the concentration of interest. Multiple standard curves were generated at various wavelengths (see Figures S7 through S15) and three wavelengths were chosen that spanned a low, medium and high concentration range (Figure 1C). At 300, 400 and 450 nm, a 50 to 2500 µM, 2500 to 10,000 µM and 5000 to 100,000 µM cerium (IV) sulfate solution could be quantitated respectively.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.

Multiple wavelength cerium (IV) sulfate standard curve (n = 4). Error bars represent standard deviation and are typically smaller than the plotted marker.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0079218.g001Since cerium (IV) sulfate and hydrogen peroxide are the reactants, the amount of cerium (IV) sulfate consumed is directly proportional, by a factor of two, to the amount of hydrogen peroxide initially present. Utilizing this relationship, a simple microtiter plate method was developed based upon the absorbance of cerium (IV) sulfate. First, 100 µL of sample or DI water is added to the wells of a 96-well plate, followed by the addition of a solution of cerium (IV) sulfate. The concentration of the cerium (IV) sulfate solution added can be adjusted based upon the expected values of hydrogen peroxide in the sample. As an additional note, the cerium (IV) sulfate solution should be contain at least a sulfuric acid concentration of 10% (v/v) as a lower concentration may cause the cerium (IV) sulfate to crash out of solution upon addition to the aqueous sample, obfuscating the absorbance reading.\nThe reaction between cerium (IV) sulfate and hydrogen peroxide is immediate, often with the visible evolution of oxygen at high concentration of hydrogen peroxide. The absorbance of the plate is read immediately and the starting concentration of the cerium (IV) sulfate solution, from the DI water wells and the ending concentration, from each sample well is calculated using the standard curve generated above. The final cerium (IV) sulfate concentration is subtracted from the initial to determine the amount consumed in the reaction. Due to the stoichiometry of the reaction, the amount of cerium (IV) sulfate consumed is equal to twice the concentration of hydrogen peroxide.\nWhile this reaction is highly selective for hydrogen peroxide, as the hydrogen peroxide is consumed the equilibrium reaction between it and peracetic acid is shifted towards the formation of hydrogen peroxide from the breakdown peracetic acid into acetic acid. This additional hydrogen peroxide then can react with the cerium (IV) sulfate causing a false increase in concentration as time passes. The possibility also exists of a very slow reaction between the peracetic acid and the cerium (IV) sulfate as well. Because of these confounding factors, the plate absorbance should be read immediately as the false increase in hydrogen peroxide concentration, as measured by the decrease in absorbance was determined to be ~2% per minute (see Figures S16).\nTo compare the results obtained from the plate based hydrogen peroxide detection to those obtained from a titration, several dilutions of a peracetic acid/hydrogen peroxide solution were made and the concentration of hydrogen peroxide was determined by both methods. As can be seen in Figure 2, the two methods show good agreement generally being within the error of one another.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 2.

Utilizing the potassium iodide reaction, the total amount of peroxides present can be determined. To accomplish this, a standard curve of iodine was established. First, 100 µL of DI water, 50 µL of 3% sulfuric acid and 50 µL of various concentrations of iodine were added to the wells of a 96-well plate. Similar to the method above, the absorbance of iodine can be measured at multiple wavelengths depending upon the concentration of interest. Multiple standard curves were generated at various wavelengths (see Figures S17 through S27) and again three wavelengths were chosen that spanned a low, medium and high concentration range (Figure 3C). At 350, 450 and 550 nm, a 100 to 1000 µM, 250 to 10,000 µM and 250 to 100,000 µM iodine could be quantitated respectively.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 3.

Multiple wavelength iodine standard curve (n = 4). Error bars represent standard deviation and are typically smaller than the plotted marker.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0079218.g003The addition of sulfuric acid to the reaction between potassium iodide and peroxide greatly increases the rate. As shown in Figure 4A, low concentrations of sulfuric acid do not result in a rapid reaction. A fairly wide range of concentrations centered at ~3% sulfuric acid provide a window for a stable reaction. However, at very high concentrations of sulfuric acid an increase in iodine production is observed. At these high acid concentrations, the potassium iodide itself can react to generate iodine (Figure 4B). This auto-reaction of potassium iodide is only significant if very low levels of total peroxides are being quantitated and this bias can be mitigated by reading the plate quickly after the addition of potassium iodide. From these results and the stability of the generated iodine in various concentrations of sulfuric acid (see Figure S28), a concentration of 3% sulfuric was determined to be most optimal.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 4.

As can be seen in Figure 5, the two methods were in good agreement generally being within the error of one another. However, the values reported are total peroxides. To yield the concentration of peracetic acid alone, the values obtained from the specific hydrogen peroxide method can be subtracted from the total peroxide concentration.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 5.

The hydrogen peroxide can react with acetic acid to form peracetic acid. The hydrogen peroxide can also breakdown into oxygen and water while the peracetic acid can break down into oxygen and acetic acid or reverse its formation reaction and return to hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid. Due to these multiple pathways, which can occur in a pH dependent manner, the degradation time of these two peroxides together in solution can be difficult to calculate.\nTo show the utility of the microtiter plate based method and to determine the degradation of both peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide in a PBS solution buffered to physiological pH, the degradation of a peracetic acid/hydrogen peroxide solution was determined by both the microtiter plate and titration methods. As shown in Figure 6, both peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide rapidly degraded with less than 2% and 0.2% of the starting concentration remaining after 96 hours respectively. Interestingly, the hydrogen peroxide degraded faster than if it were in solution alone. This is mostly likely due to it reacting with the acetic acid in solution to form more peracetic acid which then in turn degrades to acetic acid and oxygen. It should also be noted that the degradation curves from the two different methods yielded very similar results for both peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 6.

Data represents average of all three dilutions and error bars represent standard deviation.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0079218.g006\nThe quantitation of peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide is of great importance in many industries. However, the availability of rapid quantitation methods that can determine both peroxides in numerous samples was found to be lacking. We were able to adapt the most widely used titration chemistries, the conversion of cerium (IV) sulfate to cerium (III) sulfate and potassium iodide to iodine for use in a two step absorbance microtiter plate method. This new plate based method could be used to rapidly determine the concentration of both hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid in numerous samples and was found to closely agree with the values obtained during titrations for total peroxides, peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide. The utility of this method was demonstrated by querying the degradation profiles of hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid in physiological buffer conditions. In summary, a new, convenient, rapid, absorbance based high-throughput method for the determination of hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid based upon titration chemistries has been developed."

            "fulltext": "IntroductionThe quest for increased capacity and cost reduction drives miniaturization (and automation) of chemical analysis methods in life science and chemistry. However, many standard techniques, such as gel electrophoresis (GE) of proteins, DNA fragments, and other large molecules, do not lend themselves to straightforward miniaturization to “lab-on-a-chip” systems. In the specific case of GE, the uniformity of the gel, the resolution of the detection method, and the presence of undesired chemical reactions at the electrodes each impart limitations on how small effective separation devices can be. Advances in gel polymerization technology and the use of difference gel electrophoresis [1] (DIGE) have reduced the magnitude and consequences of spatial variations in gel properties dramatically, and improved imaging and detection methods have increased the resolution of the resulting gel images. In this paper, we begin to address the third (and less-frequently discussed) challenge - the electrochemical reactions at the electrodes - by performing a preliminary study exploring the potential for using electrochemically-active conjugated polymer electrodes instead of metal electrodes. Such polymer electrodes can eliminate undesired electrochemical products, reduce manufacturing costs, inhibit cross-contamination between gels, and prevent the consumption of the aqueous electrolyte, which is particularly important when reducing the volume of gel used in systems which are not immersed in electrolyte.\nSimply put, electrophoresis requires the maintenance of a direct current (DC) or steady electric field in an electrolyte. This is traditionally accomplished through Faradaic reactions occurring at the interface where each electrode (anode and cathode) contacts the electrolyte. In most cases, the overall electrochemical reaction is the electrolysis of water, forming O2 gas, H+, and H2O2 at the anode, and H2 gas, and OH− at the cathode. These products are all undesirable, as the gases produced effectively reduce the active electrode area, and the acid and base can negatively impact the molecules (proteins) being separated, particularly when electrophoresis of proteins in their native structure is intended. Furthermore, miniaturized devices often contain relatively small quantities of water, limiting that available for electrolysis before the device literally dries out.\nThis challenge can be addressed by oxidizing and reducing material that remains attached to or within the electrodes. The first class of materials most would consider includes metals such as Ag/AgCl, which are often either too reactive or otherwise incompatible with proteins and DNA fragments. However, the collection of pi-conjugated polymers developed for the printed electronics industry includes many materials that are both conductive and electrochemically active, and are an attractive alternative to metals due to their low cost, flexibility, biocompatibility, and ability to be deposited using a variety of processes.\nThe oxidation of most electrochemically-active pi-conjugated polymers can be represented as follows:where P0 represents a segment of an undoped polymer chain, X− represents an anion (such as Cl−), and e− represents an electron. The oxidized polymer segment can be reduced via the reverse process.\nWe chose to test the suitability of a widely-used blend of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and sodium poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS) in the “bath-free” PHAST (TM) SDS-PAGE system from GE (here, General Electric) Healthcare Life Sciences (formerly Pharmacia). The polymer blend, denoted PEDOT:PSS, forms an aqueous emulsion that can easily be printed, coated, or cast into various forms. The negatively-charged PSS acts as the counter ion when PEDOT is oxidized (positively charged):where M+ represents a metal cation (such as Na+). This type of electrochemistry is the basis for a wide variety of electronic devices, such as electrochemical transistors [2], [3], electrochromic displays [4], and bioelectronic [5] and microfluidic [6], [7] devices. PEDOT:PSS, when manufactured, contains a mixture of doped (oxidized, positively charged) and undoped (reduced, neutral) PEDOT segments, and can therefore be used for both the anode and cathode material. Note that previous (capillary) electrophoresis systems employing conjugated polymers appear to have been designed to simply use the polymer electrodes to drive electrolysis, rather than to mitigate electrolysis [8].\nHowever, there are limitations when using π-conjugated polymer electrodes to mitigate the electrolysis of water in applications like gel electrophoresis. Most polythiophenes, including PEDOT, are susceptible to irreversible overoxidation when large potentials (>1 V) are applied in the presence of water and/or oxygen, particularly under basic conditions [9], [10]. Overoxidation breaks the conjugation in the polymer, rendering the polythiophene non-conductive and therefore unusable for electronic or electrochemical applications. Another limitation of oxidizing and/or reducing a pi-conjugated polymer electrode instead of electrolyzing water is the limited electrochemical capacity available. Unlike the water, which in some GE configurations is seemingly limitless, the capacity available for oxidation or reduction is a function of the size of the polymer electrode and the relative fraction of the doped and undoped material contained within. We have previously measured this capacity to be 10 C per g of “dry” PEDOT [6]. Both of these limitations can be overcome with proper device design, as demonstrated by the results presented in this work.\nIn addition to eliminating undesirable side-reactions at the electrodes, replacing or supplementing the fixed, expensive Pt electrodes in GE systems with electrochemically-active conducting polymer electrodes allows the electrodes to be incorporated into the gel during production via relatively inexpensive printing or coating processes. Including the electrodes in a prefabricated gel package, in turn, reduces the possibility of contamination between gels run successively in the same equipment, and facilitates reliable electronic contact between the gel and the driving electronics, enabling further miniaturization of GE systems, particularly when techniques such as DIGE help eliminate the effect of imperfections and variations within the gels themselves.\nAs such, in the work presented here, we have verified the compatibility of PEDOT:PSS with buffers containing sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS) and widely used in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), both ex-situ in a simple electrochemical cell, and in-situ, in a real SDS-PAGE protein separation.\nMaterials and MethodsWe chose the PhastSystem from GE Healthcare Life Sciences, for testing our materials and techniques because it is commercially available, offers relatively easy access to the gels and electrodes (e.g., neither gel nor electrodes are submerged in a liquid buffer) and is currently used in laboratories around the world. However, we performed electronic measurements both in a PhastSystem Separation Unit and with an external measurement system based on a Keithley source-measure unit (SMU). The latter system offered considerably higher measurement resolution. The polyacrylamide (PA) gel (PhastGel 8–25, GE Healthcare) and accompanying agarose PhastGel SDS Buffer Strips (GE Healthcare), which together supply the liquid SDS buffer/electrolyte, were used in both measurement setups. Before any of these measurements, we quickly verified the ability of the PEDOT:PSS electrodes to undergo electrochemical oxidation and reduction in the SDS/TRIS electrolyte used in the PhastSystem.\n\nVerification of Electrochemical Compatibility between SDS/TRIS Electrolyte and PEDOT:PSS Electrodes\nTo quickly verify the compatibility of the SDS/TRIS electrolyte with PEDOT:PSS electrodes, we coated a standard glass microscope slide with a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS by spreading a drop of the polymer blend with the edge of a second microscope slide. After allowing the polymer film to dry, a line was scored across the width of the slide with a scalpel, creating two electronically-isolated PEDOT:PSS film electrodes on the glass slide. A thin slice of a PHAST buffer strip (agarose gel containing SDS and TRIS) was placed on top of the electrodes, bridging the gap between them and covering about 50% of each. Applying a potential of 1 V between the electrodes completed the electrochemical circuit.\n\n\nElectronic Measurements and Separation in the PhastSystem\nPEDOT:PSS electrodes were fabricated by molding about 4 g of pre-baked (24 hours at 60°C) Clevios S v3 (Heraeus Precious Metals GmbH), itself a relative viscous paste, in the plastic packaging in which the SDS Buffer Strips arrive from GE Healthcare. The polymer blend was then further dried in a ventilated oven at 55°C for at least 12 hours.\nBefore performing experiments in the PhastSystem, the PEDOT:PSS electrodes were placed on top of a common SDS Buffer Strip, and driven at 1 V via Pt wires inserted into each electrode for 1 hour to oxidize one electrode and reduce the other. The electrodes were then placed on top of new SDS Buffer Strips in the PhastSystem, between the buffer strips, cut to 1/2 their height to accommodate the polymer electrodes, and the Pt-coated electrodes that normally contact the SDS Buffer Strips directly. The electrode that had been reduced in the first step was used as the anode, and the electrode that had been oxidized was used as the cathode. This strategy effectively doubles the capacity of the PEDOT:PSS electrodes compared to their initial capacity, when they consisted of a more-equal blend of oxidized and reduced (neutral) PEDOT. To reduce the size of the polymer electrodes required to meet the capacity requirement for an electrophoretic separation, we cut the PA gels into 11-mm-wide strips. The SDS Buffer Strips were cut to match. The current through the gel was subsequently reduced by a factor of 4 to maintain the same current density that would normally be used if the entire width of the PA gel had been used. All PhastSystem experiments were conducted at 15°C. For performing and visualizing protein separation, we used GE Healthcare’s Full Range Rainbow Recombinant Protein Molecular Weight Marker. The sample to be separated was placed on a 2 µl sample holder (GE Healthcare) in the PhastSystem. The separation was performed using the program outlined in table 1.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 1.

PEDOT:PSS electrodes were drop-cast onto two glass slides. A Pt wire was embedded into each electrode. An 11-mm-wide strip of the PA gel (PhastGel 8–25) was placed face-up on a lab bench. A buffer strip was placed on either end of the gel, similar to their placement during PhastSystem operation. The glass slides were placed on top of the buffer strips with the polymer electrode facing down. Connecting the Pt wire from each electrode to a Keithley 2636 source-measure unit completed the electrochemical cell, and allowed a constant potential to be applied while the current through the cell was measured.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.  Schematic of the electrochemical cell tested with PEDOT:PSS electrodes.The Pt wires were inserted into the SDS Buffer Strips for the reference experiments.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0089416.g001\nResults and DiscussionAs described in the methods section, we built a simple electrochemical cell with two thin PEDOT:PSS electrodes on glass microscope slides connected by a SDS Buffer Strip. The PEDOT:PSS electrodes were reversibly and repeatedly oxidized and reduced by switching the polarity of an applied potential of 1 V. This was observed by a color change (electrochromism) between dark (reduced PEDOT) and light (oxidized PEDOT) blue within the electrodes, demonstrating the transport of ions between and into the electrodes, as shown in the video in the supplementary information (Video S1). Note that only the region of PEDOT:PSS contacting (under) the SDS Buffer Strip (the region directly above the silver pads used for contacting the device with the probes from the power source) is available for electrochemistry. The observed color change confirmed the compatibility of the SDS and TRIS buffer with the PEDOT:PSS, particularly that the ions are able to migrate into the partially-hydrated polymer, allowing the PEDOT through the entire thickness of the electrode to switch.\nNext, we compared the electronic performance of PEDOT:PSS electrodes with that of standard Pt electrodes (employing water electrolysis) in both the PHAST GE system and in a separate setup (shown in figure 1) which offered more accurate current measurement. The experiment in the PhastSystem, the results of which are shown in figure 2, demonstrates the ion-transport equivalence between gels run with Pt electrodes and PEDOT:PSS electrodes using the program described in the methods section, but at a relatively low resolution since the PhastSystem only reports current measurements to the nearest 0.2 mA. These data represent the voltage that the PhastSystem applies in order to maintain the specified current through the device (1 mA). The data from the high-resolution measurements, performed at a constant applied potential of 1 V and then 100 V using a Keithley source-meter, are shown in figures 3 and 4, respectively. For the 1 V experiment, shown in figure 3, the difference between the current through the electrochemical cell with PEDOT:PSS electrodes shows more than 6 times the current through an equivalent cell with Pt electrodes. This demonstrates that the partially-oxidized PEDOT:PSS can be further oxidized or reduced as soon as any potential is applied, where water electrolysis does not begin in earnest until the potential approaches 1.2 V. This assures that, even at larger applied potentials, the Faradaic reactions at the electrodes are performed on the polymer and not on water, preventing electrolytic changes in pH or gas bubble generation.

[6] for more details regarding the electrochemical performance of PEDOT:PSS electrodes.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 2.

Note that the measurement using polymer electrodes shows a slightly higher current density initially, and then decreases almost linearly at a faster rate than the measurement using Pt electrodes. After about 350 seconds, the electrochemical capacity of the PEDOT:PSS electrodes is nearly fully consumed, and the current drops dramatically. This illustrates the previously-described need to design electrodes of sufficient size in any device employing the electrochemical switching of pi-conjugated polymers. Note that the electrodes used for the electrochemical measurements shown in figures 3 and 4 were taken directly from the oven, and not pre-charged using the procedure described in the Materials and Methods section.\nWe performed electrophoresis on GE Healthcare’s Full Range Rainbow Recombinant Protein Molecular Weight Marker to demonstrate the operational equivalence of the PEDOT:PSS electrodes with the standard Pt electrodes in an actual separation. Images of the resulting gels can be found in figure 5. Note that these separations were obtained during the same experiments from which the voltage vs. time data in figure 2 were collected (PhastSystem conditions shown in table 1). This experiment has been repeated at least 6 times and yielded consistent results. We verified that the PEDOT:PSS electrodes were not overoxidized during the separation in the PhastSystem by exchanging the cathode and anode and performing another separation, resulting in a similar gel image and applied voltage history.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 5.

This could require, however, the addition of SDS and electrolyte (salt) to the sample being studied.\nWe have demonstrated that PEDOT:PSS electrodes are chemically and electrochemically compatible with SDS-PAGE separations via electrophoresis of a standard benchmark protein mixture. Aside from introducing the polymer electrodes, no change is required in the protocol for performing SDS-PAGE. This result, in conjunction with our previous demonstration of the reduction of water electrolysis when using PEDOT:PSS electrodes [6], has the potential to pave the way for the development of low-cost, disposable, miniaturized GE systems for accelerated analysis in areas such as proteomics and medical diagnosis (e.g., analysis of proteins associated with tumors in bodily fluids). We hope that this will lead to more advanced and less expensive diagnoses in modern healthcare facilities and in areas of the world where advanced laboratory analyses are not yet readily available."

                "\nIn this work, we have explored the thermophysical properties of tetraalkylammonium hydroxide ionic liquids (ILs) such as tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAH) and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAH) with isomers of butanol (1-butanol, 2-butanol and 2-methyl-2-propanol) within the temperature range 293.15–313.15 K, with interval of 5 K and over the varied concentration range of ILs. The molecular interactions between ILs and butanol isomers are essential for understanding the function of ILs in related measures and excess functions are sensitive probe for the molecular interactions. Therefore, we calculated the excess molar volume (VE) and the deviation in isentropic compressibility (Δκs) using the experimental values such as densities (ρ) and ultrasonic sound velocities (u) that are measured over the whole compositions range at five different temperatures (293.15, 298.15, 303.15, 308.15 and 313.15 K) and atmospheric pressure. These excess functions were adequately correlated by using the Redlich–Kister polynomial equation. It was observed that for all studied systems, the VE and Δκs values are negative for the whole composition range at 293.15 K. And, the excess function follows the sequence: 2-butanol>1-butanol>2-methyl-2-propanol, which reveals that (primary or secondary or tertiary) position of hydroxyl group influence the magnitude of interactions with ILs. The negative values of excess functions are contributions from the ion-dipole interaction, hydrogen bonding and packing efficiency between the ILs and butanol isomers. Hence, the position of hydroxyl group plays an important role in the interactions with ILs. The hydrogen bonding features between ILs and alcohols were analysed using molecular modelling program by using HyperChem 7.\n"

            "fulltext": "IntroductionTill date numerous research groups have focused their work on the study of fascinating physical properties of ionic liquids (ILs), due to their wide variety of applications in industries and applied chemistry [1]–[16]. For the applications in chemical and industrial processes, the knowledge of the thermophysical properties of IL is essential, as they represent the basis for the chemical and biological process [17]–[28]. Many of these studies have led to new possible applications for ILs [18]–[21]. Knowledge of structure and properties of ILs is essential for the understanding of their molecular interactions in the binary mixtures [4]–[6], [8]–[16]. Nevertheless, in order to transfer the ILs from laboratory to industry, designing future processes and equipment involving these ionic compounds, an accurate knowledge about their physical properties, either for pure ILs or mixed with other solvents, is crucial. Therefore, a deep knowledge of thermophysical properties of ILs and their liquid mixtures are essentially required for scientific community. Apparently, the physicochemical properties of ILs are quite sensitive toward the structure and nature of cations and anions [7]–[11]. The variations in thermophysical properties of ILs, such as density (ρ) and speed of sound (u) are observed to be very sensitive to the change in ion, mainly due to the microscopic level interactions between solvent molecules [12]–[16].\nBinary mixtures of ILs with other solvents can also improve the thermodynamic and transport properties of working fluids as well as the efficiency of the chemical equipments such as batteries, photoelectrical cells, and other electrochemical apparatus. The use of the binary mixtures of ILs with polar compounds such as alcohols allows the change and control of the properties of the mixtures to suit a given situation [29].Thermodynamic properties of mixtures containing ILs and alcohols are important for both the design of many technological processes and an understanding of the solute–solvent interactions in the mixtures. These properties are required in the development of models for process design, energy efficiency, and in the evaluation of possible environmental impacts [30]. Regarding the study of physical properties for binary mixtures of alcohol+ILs, a large number of works have been published in recent years [31]–[41], showing the interest of the scientific community for this field. While, still there is no experimental or theoretical results are available for the thermophysical properties between the tetraalkylammonium hydroxide and butanol isomers. Additionally, there is no study to show the interactions between the hydroxide anion of the IL and hydroxyl group of alcohols.\nIn this research to study these interaction, we explore and compare the measurements of two thermophysical properties such as ρ and u of binary mixtures involving 1-butanol, 2-butanol and 2-methyl-2-propanol with tetrapropylammonium hydroxide [(C3H7)4N][OH] (TPAH) and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide [(C4H9)4N][OH] (TBAH) ILs over a complete mole fraction range at various temperatures from 293.15 to 313.15 K, with interval of 5 K. Further, the excess molar volume (VE), and deviation in isentropic compressibilities (Δκs) were calculated using experimental data. The resulting VE and Δκs values were found to be strongly dependent on the place of hydroxyl group attached in the chain and also on the interactions between the hydroxide anion of ILs and hydroxyl group of the alcohols. These deviations in physical parameters have been explained in terms of intermolecular interactions between alcohols and ILs. Additionally, the temperature also plays an important role in interaction studies. Moreover, the hydrogen bonding features between ILs and alcohols were carried out to get a deep insight into intermolecular interactions for the studied compounds. These studies were performed according to the semi-empirical calculations by using HyperChem 7.\nMaterials and Methods\nMaterials\n1-butanol, 2-butanol and 2-methyl-2-propanol were obtained from Merck >99% of purity and stored over freshly activated 3 Å molecular sieves and were purified by the standard method described by Riddick et al [42]. A comparison is made for the pure alcohols in Table 1 between the experimental ρ and u values determined in the present study and those reported in the literature [31], [38], [41]–[50]. ILs were synthesized in laboratory and analysed using 1H-NMR, the preparation is given below.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 1.  Specifications of pure components and comparison of experimental densities (ρ) and ultrasonic sound velocities (u) with the literature values for alcohols.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0086530.t001\n\nSynthesis of ILs\nSynthesis of Tetrapropylammonium Hydroxide (TPAH).The synthesis of this IL was carried out in a 250 mL round bottomed flask, which was immersed in a water-bath, fitted with a reflux condenser. Solid potassium hydroxide (40 mmol) was added to a solution of tetrapropylammonium bromide [(C3H7)4N][Br] (40 mmol) in dry methylene chloride (20 mL), and the mixture was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 10 h. The precipitated KBr was filtered off, and the filtrate was then evaporated to leave the crude [(C3H7)4N][OH] as a viscous liquid that was washed with ether (2×20 mL) and dried at 343.15 K for 5 h to obtain the pure IL. The sample was analyzed by Karl Fisher titration and revealed very low levels of water (below 70 ppm). The yield of TPAH was 82%. 1H NMR (DMSOd6): δ (ppm) 0.8 (t, 12H), 1.46 (m, 8H), 2.92 (t, 8H), 4.56 (s, OH). HRMS calculated for C12H29NO (M+ - OH) 203.36, found 203.25.\n\nSynthesis of Tetrabutylammonium Hydroxide (TBAH).A procedure similar to that above for [(C3H7)4N][OH] was followed with the exception of the use of [(C4H9)4N][Br] ([cation]) instead of [(C3H7)4N][Br]. The yield of TBAH was 82%. 1H NMR (DMSOd6): δ (ppm) 0.94 (t, 12H), 1.37 (m, 8H), 1.96 (m, 8H), 3.43 (t, 8H), 4.78 (s, OH). HRMS calculated for C16H37NO (M+ - OH) 259.47 found out to be 259.34.\n\n\n\nExperimental Procedure\nDensity (ρ) and speed of sound (u) measurements.The density (ρ) and speed of sound (u) measurements were performed with an Anton-Paar DSA 5000 with an accuracy of temperature of ±0.01 K. The uncertainties in the density and speed of sound measurements were ±0.00005 g cm−3 and 0.01 m s−1 respectively. Prior to measurements, the instrument was calibrated with deionized water and dry air as standards at 293.15 K.\nThe binary mixtures of butanol isomers and IL were prepared by mass using a high-precision analytical balance with an uncertainty of ±1×10−4 g. All of the samples were prepared immediately before the measurements to avoid variations in composition due to evaporation of the solution. Clear and air bubble free solutions were used to perform the ρ and u experiments at different temperatures. The detailed measurement procedures used were described in detail in our previous research papers [12]–[15].\n\nHydrogen Bonding through Simulation Program.The structures of ILs and alcohols were optimized based on molecular mechanics and semi-empirical calculations using the HyperChem 7 molecular visualization and simulation program [51]–[54]. Initial molecular geometry of butanol isomers and ILs were optimized with the PM3 semi-empirical calculations and single point calculations were carried out to determine the total energies. Now the optimized molecules, alcohols and IL were chosen and then placed on top of each other symmetrically (parallel) with a starting interplanar distance of 2.3 Å and the angle made by covalent bonds to the donor and acceptor atoms less than 1200 was fulfilled. Further, the geometries were optimized using geometry optimizations based on molecular mechanics (using the MM+force field) and PM3 semi-empirical calculations, the Polak-Ribiere routine with rms gradient of 0.01 as the termination condition was used. PM3 uses a set of parameters derived from a variety of experimental versus calculated molecular properties, as compared to other semiempirical methods, including the AM1 procedure [53]. Typically, nonbonded interactions are less repulsive in the PM3 procedure [54]. Hydrogen bonds were displayed using HyperChem “show hydrogen bonds” and “recompute hydrogen bond” options.\n\n\nResults and DiscussionIn order to have the better understanding of the molecular interactions between tetraalkylammonium hydroxide ILs with polar solvents such as 1-butanol, 2-butanol and 2-methyl-2-propanol, we have measured ρ and u properties over the whole composition range at various temperatures such as 293.15, 298.15, 303.15, 308.15 and 313.15 K under atmospheric pressure. The experimental ρ and u values of ILs with alcohols are presented as a function of IL concentration in Table S1 in File S1. Further, Figures 1–4 show the measured ρ and u values for the binary mixtures of different butanol isomers with both ILs (TPAH and TBAH) at all the studied temperatures. Figures 1 and 2 reveal that the variation of ρ values of TPAH or TBAH with 1-butanol, 2-butanol and 2-methyl-2-propanol, shows similar trends. It has been found that the ρ of the mixtures increased with the increasing concentrations of the ILs in alcohols. The effect of the ILs on the ρ in the alcohols has been examined at various temperatures. It has been observed that the ρ values decreased as temperature increased in the all systems. The results in Figure 1a clearly reveal that the ρ values of the TPAH+1-butanol mixture increase sharply up to x1≈0.8000 and later become almost constant at all the temperatures. While for TPAH+2-butanol, ρ values increase up to very rich IL concentration x1≈0.9900, as shown in Figure 1b. On the other hand, ρ values for TPAH+2-methyl-2-propanol increase sharply up to x1≈0.6400 and, no prominent changes have been observed afterwards. The increase in ρ values for TPAH+alcohols mixtures is possibly due to increase in the ion pair interactions between TPAH and alcohols. This shows that the density values of the TPAH+alcohol mixtures are not affected much due to change in the position of hydroxyl group in different isomers.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.

Whereas, TBAH+2-butanol mixtures have similar trends as shown earlier by TPAH+2-butanol, ρ values increase up to very rich IL concentration x1≈0.9900, as depicted by Figure 2b. Further, TBAH+2-methyl-2-propanol mixture shows the increase in ρ values, while ρ doesn't increase sharply at mole fraction 0.5000–0.9900, which may be due to decrease in ion-pair interactions between TBAH and 2-methyl-2-propanol, as shown in Figure 2c. From Table S1 in File S1, we observed that the densities of investigated systems increase with increasing the length of alkyl chain in IL. It was found that ρ values to be higher in the TBAH+butanol isomers as compared to TPAH+butanol isomers at equimolar mixture. Whereas, according to early documented research articles the density decreases with increase in alkyl chain in a cation or anion [55], [56]. These discrepancies vary from IL to IL and solvent to solvent and also depend on the nature as well as structural arrangement of IL and solvent. Moreover, from close look on the Table S1 in File S1, we observed that with increase in temperature, ρ values of TBAH+butanol isomers decreases more as compared to TPAH+butanol isomers. This might be due to the assumption that the ion-pair interaction decreases more for high alkyl chain+butanol isomers as compared to lower alkyl chain+butanol isomers with the increase in temperature.\nUltrasonic sound velocities (u) prove to be an informative source regarding the properties of different solvents and their mixture. The values of u were found to decrease with an increase in temperature while u values increased with increasing in mole fraction of IL. As noted from Figures 3 and 4, there is a sharp increase of u in all ILs, except in the mixture of TPAH with 1-butanol at 293.15 K, in the mole fraction range from 0.8000 to 0.9900 of IL. Over this range, the u values decrease slightly for the mixtures of TPAH with 1-butanol at 293.15 K. Whereas, no change is observed in rest of the IL+butanol isomers at all investigated temperatures. This u value is significantly increased in IL-solvent interactions when the mole fraction of IL was increased. If we compare the TBAH+1-butanol to TPAH+1-butanol, it has been observed that the u values slightly decrease when the alkyl substituents size of cation increases. Whereas, the same trend was observed on comparing the u values of TBAH+2-methyl-2-propanol to TPAH+2-methyl-2-propanol. It has been found that the u values slightly decrease when the size of cation increases. While the u value for TPAH+2-butanol are lower than TBAH+2-butanol, which again reveal that u values slightly increase as the size of cation increases. Hence, our results lead to conclusion that interactions of ILs with alcohols, depends upon the position of the hydroxyl group.\nThermophysical properties of mixed solvents of ILs with butanol isomers can be tunable. The extent of deviation of liquid mixtures from ideal behavior is best expressed by excess functions. Excess molar volumes (VE) as well as ultrasonic studies are known to provide useful insights into solution structural effects and intermolecular interactions between component molecules. The extent of deviation of liquid mixtures from ideal behavior is best expressed by excess functions. Volumetric properties of binary mixtures of ILs with polar compounds are contributed to the clarification of the various intermolecular interactions existing between the different species found in solution. The excess volumes are determined from the density of pure compounds (ρ1 and ρ2) and mixture (ρm) using a standard equation [15]. The ultrasonic studies have been adequately employed in understanding the nature of molecular interaction in solvent mixed systems. In the chemical industry, knowledge of the ultrasonic and its related properties of solutions are essential in the design involving chemical separation, heat transfer, mass transfer, and fluid flow. Isentropic compressibilities (κs) of the binary mixtures were calculated using the relation from ρ and u. The composition dependence of the VE and Δκs properties represents the deviation from ideal behavior of the mixtures and provides an indication of the interactions between IL and alcohols. These properties were mathematically fitted by variable degree functions using the Redlich-Kister expression:(1)(2)Where Y refers to VE or Δκs. ai are adjustable parameters and can be obtained by least-squares analysis. Values of the fitted parameters are listed in Table S2 in File S1, along with the standard deviations of the fit. The values of VE and Δκs for the binary mixtures at various temperatures as function of ILs concentrations are included in Table S1 in File S1. Figures 5 to 10 display the experimental data for the binary mixtures, and the fitted curves, along with the excess properties of VE and Δκs for the butanol isomers with ILs as function of IL concentrations at different temperatures.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 5.

We have observed that the excess molar volumes present a minimum at x1≈0.5634 for TPAH+1-butanol at all investigated temperatures, whereas we obtained that the VE values present a minimum at x1≈0.4143 for the TPAH+2-butanol system. Further, minimum VE values lie at x1≈0.4244 for TPAH+2-methyl-2-propanol system at all investigated temperatures. The minimum VE values could be due to hydrogen bonds between alcohols and TPAH IL. The decrease in the magnitude of the negative VE values with an increase in the IL composition can be attributed to the decrease of hydrogen bonding. In other words, due to increase in the concentration of the IL results in decrease of packing efficiency. Further, with increase in temperature the magnitude of the negative VE values decreases in all the TPAH+butanol isomers systems. This can again be due to decrease in magnitude of the hydrogen bonding with increase in the temperature.\nIt is interesting to note that the VE values in TPAH+2-methyl-2-propanol mixture show more negative values of VE at the alcohol-rich composition than the TPAH+1-butanol and TPAH+2-butanol mixtures at 293.15 K (Figure 7a), implying that in the TPAH+2-methyl-2-propanol, there are ion-dipole interactions and packing effects with 2-methyl-2-propanol which are stronger than those in the 2-butanol and 1-butanol solution at x1≈0.4200. A comparison between the negative deviation of VE of TPAH+2-methyl-2-propanol, TPAH+1-butanol and TPAH+2-butanol suggests that there is a difference of the hydroxyl position in the alkyl chain, leading to variation in the interactions between the alcohols and TPAH. Molecular interaction between TPAH and alcohols follows the following order at 293.15 K, 2-methyl-2-propanol>1-butanol>2-butanol.\nFurther, the negative VE values are observed for TBAH+butanol isomers at all measured temperatures over whole composition range, except 2-butanol at higher temperatures 293.15 to 313.15 K. The VE values for 1-butanol with TBAH are as represented in Figure 6a. And, we found that negative VE values are observed over the entire mole fraction range at all investigated temperatures. These negative VE values reveal that a more efficient packing or attractive interaction occurred between the TBAH and 1-butanol. 1-Butanol forms a hydrogen bond with the alkyl chain cation, while the interactions decrease at higher temperatures. The interactions between the 1-butanol molecules and the alkyl chain of TBAH are due to ion-dipole or hydrogen bonding interactions. This will reduce the interactions between the tetrabutylammonium cation and hydroxide anion in the IL, which contributes to the negative VE values. Furthermore, the observed positive VE values for TBAH+2-butanol at higher temperatures show that there exist no specific interactions between unlike molecules, as displayed in Figure 6b. The magnitude and sign of VE values are a reflection of the type of interaction staking place in the mixture, which are the result of different effects containing the loss of the dipole interaction from each other and the breakdown of the IL ion pair (positive VE). The interaction between the ion pair of ILs increases as compared to IL+2-butanol interactions, which leads to positive contribution at higher temperature over whole composition range. While, Figure 6c shows the negative VE values for TBAH+2-methyl-2-propanol at all measured temperatures over whole composition range. This might be due to the large difference between the molar volumes of the 2-methyl-2-propanol and TPAH implying that it is possibly due to the fact that the relatively small organic molecules fit into the interstices upon mixing. Therefore, the filling effect of organic molecular liquids in the interstices of ILs, and the ion-dipole interactions between organic molecular liquid and alkyl cation of ammonium ILs, all contribute to the negative values of VE.\nClearly, the observed negative VE values increases further with increasing the temperature in the entire mole fraction range for all IL systems. It is interesting to note that the VE values in the ILs+2-methyl-2-propanol mixture shows more negative values of VE than the IL+2-butanol and IL+1-butanol mixtures at 298.15 K over the alcohol rich concentration range (Figure 7), implying that in the 2-methyl-2-propanol there is strong ion-dipole interactions and packing effects with ILs as compared to 2-butanol and 1-butanol. The magnitude and sign of VE values are a reflection of the type of interactions taking place in the mixture, which reveals that VE values are more negative for TBAH (VE = −8.149 cm3.mol−1 at x1 = 0.2831 for TBAH+2-methyl-2-propanoland VE = −5.787 cm3.mol−1 at x1 = 0.5428 for TBAH+2-butanol) than TPAH (VE = −7.547 cm3.mol−1 at x1 = 0.4143 for TPAH+2-methyl-2-propanol and VE = −5.702 cm3.mol−1 at x1 = 0.5634 for TPAH+2-butanol) in all systems except in ILs+1-butanol systems. For TBAH+1-butanols (VE = −2.448 cm3.mol−1 at x1 = 0.5993) and VE = −3.175 cm3.mol−1 at x1 = 0.4139 for TPAH+1-butanol, hence the VE is more negative for the TPAH+1-butanol than TBAH+1-butanol due to steric hindrance created by the long chain cation of TBAH, that reduces the interaction magnitude between TBAH and 1-butanol. Interestingly, the hydrogen bonding between ILs and butanol isomers has predicted using semiempirical calculations with the help of Hyperchem 7, and those interactions are explicitly elucidated in Figures S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6.\nUsing semiempirical calculations for the hydrogen bonding between ILs and butanol isomers, displayed in Figures S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, we calculated heat of formation of the complexes and compared the values with those of the ILs and butanol isomers (as displayed in Table 2). In all the cases, ΔHf of the complex resulting from hydrogen bonding was higher than the sum of ΔHf's of butanol isomers and ILs. It is reasonable to assume that these differences (ΔΔHf), calculated according to equation 3, represent the energies of the hydrogen bond. The energies of the hydrogen bonding can also obtained by using the total binding energies of butanol isomers [54] and ILs, presented in Table 2, instead of ΔHf's for these calculations. The results in Table 2 indicate that the energy required for the formation of a weak hydrogen bond is less than required for the formation of a stronger hydrogen bond:(3)Where ΔHf (1) is the heat of formation of the butanol isomers, ΔHf (2) the heat of formation of the ILs and ΔHf (3) the heat of formation of the complex (butanol isomers and ILs).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 2.  Calculated binding energies (E), heats of formations (ΔHf), and estimated hydrogen bond energies (ΔΔHf) (kcal/mol).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0086530.t002A glance at the Figure S1, illustrated the hydrogen bonding between nitrogen group of TPAH IL with the “-OH” group of 1-buatnol. The binding energy of the TPAH is found to be −3784.96 kcal/mol and that of 1-butanol is found to be −1330.63 kcal/mol, but after the hydrogen bonding occur between the TPAH and 1-butanol, the binding energy of complete system comes out to be −5117.47 kcal/mol (Table 2). Hence, the estimated hydrogen bond energy of the above system is ≈1.87 kcal/mol, which could probably due to the interaction of TPAH with 1-butanol that leads to decrease in energy (less than sum of individual energy of TPAH and 1-butanol), and increase in the strength of hydrogen bonding. Similarly, the Figures S2 and S3, depict the possibility of hydrogen bonding between the nitrogen group of TPAH IL with hydroxyl group of 2-butanol and 2-methyl-2-propanol and the estimated hydrogen bond energies are ≈4.14 and ≈0.64 kcal/mol respectively (Table 2). This shows that the strength of hydrogen bonding is more for TPAH+2-butanol as compared to other butanol isomers. Further, the Figures S4 to S6, clearly again show the hydrogen bonding between the nitrogen group of TBAH with hydroxyl group of 1-butanol, 2-butanol and 2-methyl-2-propanol and now the hydrogen bond energies are ≈0.39, ≈2.29 and ≈0.08 respectively. Hence, we may conclude that the hydrogen bond in case of TBAH+2-butanol is stronger as compared to other butanol isomers.\nOur interpretation of hydrogen bonding between of IL and butanol isomers (based VE data) is quite corroborated with our theoretical calculation of hydrogen bonding of IL+butanol isomers. It is noteworthy that the hydroxyl groups of alcohols are interacting with the nitrogen group of ILs (TPAH and TBAH) (Figures S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6). According to literature, the negative VE values are a result of contributions from both the accommodation of organic molecules in the interstice of the IL networks and the ion–dipole interactions between the organic molecules and cation of the ionic liquid [38], [57]. Our experimental results reveal that the negative VE values for entire composition and theoretical calculation suggested that hydroxyl groups of alcohols are interacting with the cation of ILs, as illustrated in Figures S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6. Hence, our results are very well correlated with literature results. Therefore, the absolute value of VE is an indicative to the difference in the packing efficiency and the interaction intensity. As can be seen from Figure 7, the VE values for the studied systems follow the sequence: 2-methyl-2-propanol>1-butanol>2-butanol. If only ion–dipole interactions are taken into consideration, the order 1-butanol>2-butanol>2-methyl-2-propanol is understandable. The decreased dielectric constant from 1-butanol (17.8), 2-butanol (16.6) and 2-methyl-2-propanol (10.9) leads to the weaker ion–dipole interaction and in turn resulting in the smaller VE values. Whereas, if we consider the energies of the hydrogen bond (Table 2), the order for ILs+butanol isomers follows: 2-butanol>1-butanol>2-methyl-2-propanol. Our experimental results suggest the order 2-methyl-2-propanol>1-butanol>2-butanol, which reveal that the interactions are not only due to individual contribution of ion-dipole interaction or H-bonding, but it is the combined effect of both the factors. Whereas, another plausible reason is that the butanol isomers makes it easy to accommodate in the interstice of the IL network, and the higher packing efficiency also leads to the larger VE values. While, with increase in temperature there is decrease in VE values in all the systems because at higher temperature the packing efficiency decreases of ILs. On the other hand, the ion-dipole interactions also decrease with the increase in temperature that leads to decrease in VE values.\nFurther, for better understanding of the interactions between the tetraalkylammonium hydroxide ILs, we have calculated the Δκs. As seen in Figure 8, Δκs values of tetraalkylammonium hydroxide ILs+butanol isomers are negative over the full composition range at 293.15 K as a function of ILs concentration.The behavior of Δκs, implies that these mixtures are less compressible than the ideal mixture. This is due to closer approach of unlike molecules and a stronger interaction between components of mixtures that leads to a decrease in the compressibility. From Figure 8a, it can be seen that the minimum Δκs values are observed at mole fraction of IL ≈0.4141 for the TPAH+1-butanol system. The negative Δκs values of TPAH+1-butanol are attributed to the strong attractive interactions due to the solvation of the ions in these solvents, over the complete composition range and at all studied temperatures. Similarly, the curves in Figure 8 (c and d), show that the Δκs values for the 2-butanol or 2-methyl-2-propanol+TPAH systems are negative over the complete composition range and at all studied temperatures, except at the higher temperatures (308.15 and 313.15 K) for ≈0.8100 to 0.9999 composition range. The minimum is approached at mole fraction of IL ≈0.4171, ≈0.3272 and ≈0.3138 for the TPAH+1-butanol, TPAH+2-butanol and TPAH+2-methyl-2-propanol systems at all temperatures, respectively. The negative Δκs values attributed to the strong attractive interactions between the molecules of the components. The negative values of Δκs of the TPAH with butanol isomers imply that solvent molecules around solute are less compressible than the solvent molecules in the bulk solutions. Whereas on further addition of IL, there is decrease in the compressibility graph at all studied temperature ranges. This might be due to the decreased attraction between IL and butanol isomers in IL rich concentration region. Additionally, for the 2-butanol and 2-methyl-2-propanol, there are positive Δκs values at higher temperatures, this is might be again due to decrease in attraction of TPAH and alcohol molecules in the IL-rich concentration region, since the interaction between the ILs increases and whereas decreases in case of IL and alcohols.\nFigure 9 depicts the negative Δκs values of all TBAH+butanol isomers over the full composition range at 293.15 K. The curves in Figure 9 show that the Δκs values for the 1-butanol or 2-butanol or 2-methyl-2-propanol systems are negative over the complete composition range at low temperature. The minimum is approached at mole fractions of IL ≈0.4787, ≈0.4604 and ≈0.1985 for the TBAH+1-butanol, TBAH+2-butanol and TBAH+2-methyl-2-propanol systems, respectively. Our results show that for all the system, TBAH+butanol isomers shows the positive Δκs values in the IL-rich region at the higher temperatures. These results are very similar with the TPAH+alcohols at higher temperature, which might be due to the decrease in the attraction of TBAH and alcohol molecules in the IL-rich concentration region due to the increased interaction between the ILs and the decreased interaction between IL and alcohols. Obviously, the Δκs values in the ILs+2-methyl-2-propanol mixture shows more negative values of Δκs than the ILs+2-butanol and ILs+1-butanol mixtures at 293.15 K over the entire concentration range (Figure 10), implying that in the 2-methyl-2-propanol there is strong ion-dipole interactions and packing effects with ILs as compared to 2-butanol and 1-butanol. The magnitude and sign of Δκs values are a reflection of the type of interactions taking place in the mixture, which reveals that Δκs values are more negative for TBAH+2-methyl-2-propanol (Δκs = −211.351TPa−1 at x1 = 0.1985), than TBAH+1-butanol (Δκs = −168.519TPa−1 at x1 = 0.4787), and least is for TBAH+2-butanol (Δκs = −144.998TPa−1 at x1 = 0.4604). For TPAH+2-methyl-2-propanol (Δκs = −264.189TPa−1 at x1 = 0.3115), TPAH+1-butanol (Δκs = −222.322TPa−1 at x1 = 0.3218), and TPAH+2-butanol (Δκs = −153.949TPa−1 at x1 = 0.0.3244). TPAH+butanol isomers have more negative Δκs values then TBAH+butanol isomers this is might be due to the steric hindrance created by the long chain cation of TBAH, which reduces the interaction magnitude between TBAH and alcohols.\nHowever, after close look about the physical properties of alcohols with ILs, we observed that hydroxyl position of alcohols are playing important role in addition to the cation chain length of the ILs. ILs (TPAH or TBAH) interact strongly with the 2-methyl-2-propanol as compared to the 2-butanol and 1-butanol, this is might be due to more+I-effect of 2-methyl-2-propanol, which increases its tendency to interact with ILs more strongly as compared to 2-butanol and 1-butanol. Also, 1-butanol interacts more strongly as compared to 2-butanol with ILs, which might be due to the steric hindrance the interaction of 2-butanol decreases as compared to 1-butanol. However, there is decrease in VE and Δκs values in all the system due to increase in temperature; this might be due to strong self-association between the alcohol molecules that prevents the alcohol-IL strong interactions. Our experimental results of VE values are very well supported with literature [38], [46], [47]. Wen-Lu Weng [47], showed the interactions of anisole with 2-butanol and 2-methyl-2-propanol, author observed that VE values of the 2-methyl-2-propanol is more negative than 2-butanol. Additionally, the VE values increases (less negative) with increase in temperature. Further, Qian et al. [38], showed that 1-methylimidazolium acetate IL interacts with methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol and 1-butanol, it was observed that in all the systems VE values increase with increase in the temperature. Moreover, during the interaction of formamide with 1-butanol negative VE values have been observed, whereas interaction of formamide with 2-butanol results in positive VE values [46]. These all results by various authors support our above results explanation that interactions between ILs+alcohols depend upon the position of hydroxyl group. Therefore, the physicochemical properties of ILs are quite sensitive toward the structure and nature of interacting molecules.\n\nConclusion\nWe have performed and compared thermophysical properties of binary mixtures of tetraalkylammonium hydroxide based ILs with butanol isomers over the whole composition range at various temperatures (293.15 to 313.15 K, in steps of 5 K). To obtain a more detailed picture of the molecular interactions, we measured temperature dependence properties of ρ and u for ILs with butanol isomers over the whole composition range at various temperatures. The ρ and u values increase with the increasing the cation alkyl chain length of ILs. Our results reveal that the position of hydroxyl group in alcohols leads to alteration of the thermophysical properties of ILs. To measure the non-ideality of the mixtures, we determined VE and Δκs at each temperature as a function of IL concentration. The predicted properties were correlated by the Redlich-Kister type equation. Our studies demonstrate that there is decrease in VE and Δκs values in all the systems due to increase in temperature; this might be due to strong self-association between the alcohol molecules that prevents the alcohol-IL strong interactions. Additionally, according to the theoretical calculations obtained by HyperChem 7, the energy of hydrogen bond is more for low alkyl chain ILs (TPAH) as compared to higher alkyl chain ILs (TBAH) with alcohols. Molecular interactions such as ion-dipole and hydrogen bonding between the butanol isomers and alkyl chain of ILs are suggested to be mainly responsible for variation in the thermophysical parameters. Our findings provide better molecular interactions for the mixing of the solvents and better analysis of the solvation process.\n\nFigure S1.

                "Background: Shape complementarity and non-covalent interactions are believed to drive protein-ligand interaction. To date protein-protein, protein-DNA, and protein-RNA interactions were systematically investigated, which is in contrast to interactions with small ligands. We investigate the role of covalent and non-covalent bonds in protein-small ligand interactions using a comprehensive dataset of 2,320 complexes. Methodology and Principal Findings: We show that protein-ligand interactions are governed by different forces for different ligand types, i.e., protein-organic compound interactions are governed by hydrogen bonds, van der Waals contacts, and covalent bonds; protein-metal ion interactions are dominated by electrostatic force and coordination bonds; protein-anion interactions are established with electrostatic force, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals contacts; and protein-inorganic cluster interactions are driven by coordination bonds. We extracted several frequently occurring atomic-level patterns concerning these interactions. For instance, 73% of investigated covalent bonds were summarized with just three patterns in which bonds are formed between thiol of Cys and carbon or sulfur atoms of ligands, and nitrogen of Lys and carbon of ligands. Similar patterns were found for the coordination bonds. Hydrogen bonds occur in 67% of protein-organic compound complexes and 66% of them are formed between NH- group of protein residues and oxygen atom of ligands. We quantify relative abundance of specific interaction types and discuss their characteristic features. The extracted protein-organic compound patterns are shown to complement and improve a geometric approach for prediction of binding sites. Conclusions and Significance: We show that for a given type (group) of ligands and type of the interaction force, majority of protein-ligand interactions are repetitive and could be summarized with several simple atomic-level patterns. We summarize and analyze 10 frequently occurring interaction patterns that cover 56% of all considered complexes and we show a practical application for the patterns that concerns interactions with organic compounds.

            "fulltext": "IntroductionProtein-protein and protein-ligand docking are among the central topics in structural biology. The former provides useful input for constructing protein-protein interaction networks and for understanding the protein's function, while the latter provides a basis for selection of drug candidates by virtual screening [1], [2]. To date, interactions between proteins and macromolecules, i.e., protein-protein [3], [4], protein-DNA [5], and protein-RNA [6], have been systematically investigated. Thornton's study compared the size, shape, residue interface propensities and hydrophobicity of the protein-protein interface for four different types of protein-protein complexes [3]. Luscombe and colleagues studies the role of hydrogen bonds, van der Waals contacts and water mediated bonds in protein-DNA interaction. They concluded that the majority of the amino acid-base interactions observed follow general principles that apply across all protein-DNA complexes [5]. Rajamani and colleagues show that the anchor residues in protein-protein interactions maintain similar conformations before and after the binding, which allows for a relatively smooth binding process [7]. Ma's report shows that several structurally conserved residues could be used to distinguish between binding sites and general exposed surface; for instance, conservation of Trp, Phe, and Met residues on the protein surface was shown to be associated with a higher likelihood of formation of a binding site [8]. The principles that govern protein-metal ion interaction were recently reviewed by Dudev and Lim. They summarized several rules with respective to the coordination mode, coordination number, metal selectivity and coordination stereochemistry [9]. In another review by Dudev and Lim, various factors governing metal binding affinity and selectivity were systematically analyzed [10]. The structure and properties of the metal-binding sites were also discussed for specific metal ions like Ca2+ and Zn2+ [11], [12]. On the other hand, although characterization and prediction of protein-ligand interaction sites has attracted attention [13], [14], the protein-ligand interactions were never systematically studied and the rules that govern these interactions were not yet fully disclosed. The protein-ligand recognition is usually performed using an approach in which the protein and the ligand are considered as complementary surfaces [15], or by executing the actual docking process and calculating the protein-ligand interaction energies [16]. A recent study by Thornton's group reveals that pockets binding the same ligand show greater variation in their shapes than can be accounted for by the conformational variability of the ligand, which suggests that the geometrical complementarity is not sufficient to drive molecular recognition process [17]. This prompts our investigation into the interactions between proteins and ligands, in which we analyze both covalent bonds (normal covalent bonds and coordination bonds) and non-covalent bonds (electrostatic force, hydrogen bonds and van der Waals force). We focus on studying small ligands that exclude proteins, peptides, and nucleotides which were already investigated by other groups. Our aim is to find frequent regularities (patterns) that could be used to summarize interactions between the protein and the considered ligands. We analyze each of the major types of bonds for the ligands that are grouped into four categories including organic compounds, metal ions, inorganic anions, and inorganic clusters. In spite of inclusion of proteins characterized by low sequence identity and the diversity of the considered ligands, we found interesting and frequently occurring atomic-level patterns for several types of the considered ligands. We note that “atomic-level” term refers to the fact that patterns concern interactions between individual atoms of the residue and the ligand and it has no relation with the resolution of the considered crystal structures. Although the extracted patterns have been described in the literature, a comprehensive, in terms of the wide range of interaction and ligand types, overview of such interactions was not attempted. We systematically and conveniently summarize several major different interactions, we discuss specific details of these interactions across different residue types and ligands, e.g., the number of residues and the residues types that are involved in the coordination bonds with specific metal ions, and we quantify their relative abundance, which can be used to asses their importance in protein-ligand interactions. We also show, using a case study that concerns recent blind (without the knowledge of the ligand) geometric method for prediction of the binding sites, that usage of several patters in tandem improves the binding site predictions and that the sites predicted using patterns are complementary to the results based on the geometric analysis of the protein surface. Discovery of such interaction patterns would not only provide a comprehensive overview of protein-ligand interactions, but it would also facilitate design of binding site prediction methods and high-throughput molecular docking procedures.\nMaterials and Methods\nNormal covalent and coordination bonds\nThe interaction between a non-hydrogen atom A1 of a residue and a non-hydrogen atom A2 of a ligand is defined as the covalent bond if the residue and the ligand do not have the opposite charge that would result in electrostatic force and the distance d of these two atoms satisfies(1)where radius(Ai) represents the radius of Ai. As discussed by Davis and colleagues [18], in a typical 3Å resolution structure, the uncertainty of the position of the individual atoms can easily be 0.5Å or more. The marginal 0.5Å value used in formula 1 accommodates for the uncertainty of the positions of both atoms and for the variation of the length of covalent bonds, i.e., the length of a single bond between carbon atoms ranges between 1.2Å to 1.54Å.\nMetal ions usually do not contain electrons in their outer shell. Therefore, if a metal ion forms the covalent bond with another atom, the pair of electrons shared by the metal ion and the second atom should be provided by the other atom. The corresponding covalent bond is defined as the coordination bond. As a result, metal ions and non-metal atoms (on a residue) whose interaction satisfies formula 1 are assumed to form the coordination bond.\n\n\nHydrogen bond\nHydrogen bonds were calculated with HBPLUS [19]. To identify hydrogen bonds, the program finds all proximal donor (D) and acceptor (A) atom pairs that satisfy specified geometrical criteria for the formation of the bond. Theoretical hydrogen atom (H) positions of both protein and ligand are calculated with REDUCE program [20]. The criteria used for the current study are: H–A distance<2.7Å, D–A distance<3.5Å, D–H–A angle>90° and H–A–AA angle>90°, where AA is the atom attached to the acceptor.\n\n\nElectrostatic force\nAmong the 20 amino acids (AAs), the electrostatic force concerns positively charged Arg, His, and Lys residues and negatively charged Asp and Glu residues. The charge of the ligand is annotated using Protein Data Bank (PDB) [21] dictionary located at http://deposit.rcsb.org/public-component​-erf.cif, which provides the charge of each atom of the ligand. An atom of the ligand and an AA in the protein are considered to exert electrostatic force with each other if they have opposite charges and at least one non-hydrogen atom of the AA is less than 3.5Å away from the charged atom of the ligand.\n\n\nVan der Waals force\nA non-hydrogen atom A1 of a protein and a non-hydrogen atom A2 of a ligand form van der Waals contact if the distance d between these two atoms satisfies(2)where vdW(Ai) is the van der Waals radius of Ai and where these two atoms do not form covalent bond, coordination bond, hydrogen bond, and electrostatic force. This is consistent with the definition used in the investigation of protein-protein interactions by Ma and colleagues [8], in which two residues were considered to be in contact if there is at least one pair of atoms, one atom from each residue, at a distance smaller than the sum of their vdW radii plus a threshold of 0.5Å.\n\n\nThe dataset of protein-ligand complexes and distribution of the ligands in PDB\nThe protein chains, which were selected using culledPDB list generated by PISCES server [22], are characterized by the following: 1) the chains share sequence identity of below 25%; 2) the resolution of the protein-ligand complex structure is below 2.0Å; and 3) the Rwork value is below 0.25. These criteria, which resulted in selection of 2320 chains, assure that the selected proteins share low sequence identity (they adequately sample the sequence space) and that the corresponding structures have sufficient quality. The length of these chains varies between 20 and 1083, some short sequences are fragments of protein chains, and both monomers and oligomers are included. The protein and a ligand are assumed to interact with each other when at least one pair of non-hydrogen atoms, one from the protein and one from the ligand, can be found within 3.5Å distance. The minimal distance is consistent with the value used in [8]. If the same ligand binds a given protein in multiple pockets, all pocket-ligand complexes are included. Excluding the water molecule, all molecules annotated as “HET” in PDB, which includes organic compounds and ions, were taken as ligands. This excludes protein chains, peptides and nucleotides. As a result, 7759 pockets which have at least one contact with the considered ligand were extracted from the 2320 chains.\nAmong the 7759 complexes, some of the ligands appear multiple times, some are similar and could be grouped together and the same/similar ligands bind to a variety of pockets. To facilitate analysis of the protein-ligand interactions we select only these ligands that occur frequently and we group them into several categories. The ligands that bind to at least 100 pockets cover 59.4% of the considered complexes. Among these ligands, GOL, EDO, NAG, and ACT are organic compounds, Ca2+, Zn2+, Na+, Mg2+ and Cd2+ are metal ions, and SO42−, PO43−, Cl−, Br− and I− are inorganic anions. Additionally, some inorganic clusters, i.e., Fe-S cluster, also bind to a relatively large number of pockets. Therefore, the considered ligands (including those that occur in less than 100 pockets) are grouped into four categories: organic compounds, metal ions, inorganic anions, and inorganic clusters. We analyze total of 3685 organic compounds (that include 560 distinct types), 1682 metal ions (25 types), 1837 inorganic anions (19 types), and 54 inorganic clusters (9 types), which cover (3685+1682+1837+54)/7759 = 93.5% of all extracted pockets.\n\nResults\nSummary of the interaction patterns\nThe protein pocket-ligand interactions are summarized in Figure 1. The top layer divides the 7759 protein pocket-ligand complexes into 5 categories based on the ligand type. The second layer lists the major forces that are involved in formation of protein-ligand complexes for a given ligand type. For instance, protein pocket-organic compound complexes are formed mainly by the means of covalent bonds, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals contacts, which accommodate for 99.9% of the interactions. The remaining 0.1% of the contacts between a protein and the organic compound, which are omitted in the Figure 1, is based on the electrostatic force. The bottom layer provides significant patterns that are associated with interactions for a given type of the ligand and a given type of bond/force, which are discussed in detail in the following sections.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.  An overview of the protein pocket-ligand interactions.The top layer divides protein-ligand complexes into 5 major groups based on the type of the ligand. The second layer shows the major forces that are involved in formation of protein-ligand complexes for each type of the ligand. The bottom layer summarizes significant (frequently occurring) patterns for each force/bond type and each type of the ligand. The patterns are shown in XR…YL or XR – YL format where X denotes an atom type of residue R in the protein, Y denotes an atom type of the ligand L, strong interactions (covalent and coordination bonds) are depicted by “–”, and weak interactions (hydrogen bond) are represented by “…”.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0004473.g001The forces that are omitted in Figure 1 are less significant (less frequent or nonexistent) for a given type of the protein-ligand interaction. Our analysis concentrates on the forces that are characterized by frequently occurring patterns for a given ligand category, while omitting some forces which are listed in Figure 1 and for which we could not find strong regularities (patterns). For the protein-organic compound interactions, we focus on the hydrogen and covalent bonds since they exhibit more regular and frequent patterns than the van der Waals contacts. In the case of the protein-metal ion interactions, electrostatic force and coordination bonds, which cover 95% these interactions, are analyzed. The discussion of the protein-inorganic anion interactions concentrates on the electrostatic force and hydrogen bonds; the van der Waals contacts are omitted due to lack of regular interaction patterns. Finally, our analysis of the protein-inorganic cluster interactions concerns only the coordination bonds since they constitute the main driving force for these interactions, i.e., they are involved in all considered protein-inorganic cluster complexes. Although we investigate all four interaction types, in our analysis we concentrate on the protein-organic compound and the protein-metal interactions since they occupy the largest fraction of the considered protein-ligand complexes and they are important for many biological processes [24], [25].\n\n\nInteraction patterns in protein-organic compound complexes\nOrganic compounds bind to proteins mainly by the means of the van der Waals contacts and the hydrogen bonds. Total of 85771 contacts were observed between an organic compound and a protein and they include 77554 van der Waals contacts, 7914 hydrogen bonds, and 246 covalent bonds. The remaining 0.1% of contacts are due to the electrostatic force. Among the 3685 protein pocket-organic compound complexes, 1067 complexes (29%) are based solely on the van der Waals contacts, 2309 (62.7%) involve both hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts, 107 (2.9%) incorporate covalent bonds and van der Waals contacts, and 135 (3.7%) include covalent bonds, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals contacts, see Figure 2. We note that the number of hydrogen bonds is likely underestimated since REDUCE could not supply complete coordinates for hydrogen atoms of some ligands and thus some potential hydrogen bonds could not be counted.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 2.  The summary of forces/bonds that are involved in formation of protein-organic compound complexes.The chart shows that most of the complexes involve multiple contact types with the most frequent contacts involving both van der Waals force and hydrogen bonds.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0004473.g002Covalent bond.Majority of the 246 covalent bonds formed between organic compounds and proteins are summarized with four patterns: 1) 27 covalent contacts are formed between the thiol of Cys residue and the carbon atom of the organic compound (thioether bond); 2) 139 are formed between the nitrogen atom of Asn residue and the carbon atom of N-Acetyl-D-Glucosamine (NAG); 3) 28 concern the thiol of Cys residue and the sulfur atom of the organic compound (disulfide bond); and 4) 23 involve the nitrogen atom of Lys residue and the carbon atom of organic compound. We observe that the interaction between protein and NAG is established through the process of glycosylation and this interaction is not observed for other ligands. Therefore, this interaction is not included as a pattern for covalent bond. We denote the other three patterns as Scys—Cligand, Scys—Sligand, and Nlys—Cligand respectively. They cover (27+28+23)/107 = 73% of all investigated covalent bonds between proteins and organic compounds; see summary in Table 1. Both the thiol of Cys and the nitrogen atom of Lys could interact with a variety of organic compounds. This result indicates that the covalent bonds could be formed only between a few specific atoms of some AAs and a few specific atoms of the organic compounds.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 1.  A summary of interaction patterns concerning covalent bonds formed between a protein and an organic compound.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0004473.t001Since some covalent bond patterns concern only a few dozens of complexes, we investigate whether they are specific to a certain protein family or more generic and associated with a variety of families. We note that in contrast to the covalent bonds, in the case of the subsequently discussed coordination and hydrogen bonds, thousands of contacts between the proteins belonging to a wide range of families and the ligands are established. Based on SCOP classification system [23], the Scys—Cligand bonds are formed for proteins belonging to 15 families, which cover four major structural classes, i.e., all-α, all-β, α/β, and α+β. Similarly, the Scys—Sligand and Nlys—Cligand, bonds concern proteins from 15 and 10 families and 4 and 3 structural classes, respectively. This shows that the above patterns span dozens of structurally different protein families, which in turn indicates that they are not specific to a certain protein family or class.\nThioether bond and the bond between the nitrogen atom of Asn residue and the carbon atom of NAG are involved in a number of cellular activities and their formation could be associated with the protein's function. For instance, Ma's study suggests that the mycobacterium tuberculosis LipB enzyme transferase functions as a cysteine/lysine dyad acyltransferase, in which two invariant residues (Lys-142 and Cys-176) are likely to function as acid/base catalysts [24]. We observe that the tuberculosis LipB protein –decanoic acid complex is linked by thioether bond formed between Cys-176 and carbon-3 of decanoic acid. Zoltowski's study shows that formation of thioether bond between Cys thiol and the flavin C4a position is a response upon the blue-light excitation; attack of the thiol at C4a reduces the flavin ring, breaks aromaticity, and bleaches the absorption bands at 450 and 478 nm [25].. The above studies demonstrate the important role of the covalent bonds in catalysis, protein folding, and light-triggered cellular activity.\n\nHydrogen bond.Hydrogen bonds are formed in 2466/3685 = 66.9% of the organic compound based complexes. Although all 20 AAs can establish hydrogen bonds with compounds, their ability to form hydrogen bonds varies. Table 2 shows the distribution of occurrence of the hydrogen bonds formed by each AA and the occurrence of the AAs in the 3685 pockets. Seven hydrophilic residues (based on the low values of their hydropathy index [26]), including Arg, Lys, Asn, Thr, Ser, Gln, and His establish larger number of hydrogen bonds when compared their occurrence in the pockets. Moreover, six hydrophobic residues, i.e., Ala, Cys, Val, Ile, Met, and Leu, occupy 26.1% of the residues in the pockets and they form only 10.7% of the hydrogen bonds. This suggests that the hydrophilic residues form hydrogen bonds with the organic compounds more frequently when compared with the hydrophobic residues. Among the 7914 hydrogen bonds between proteins and organic compounds, AAs serve as donors for 6526 hydrogen bonds, and as acceptors for only 1371 hydrogen bonds; they serve as both donors and acceptors for the remaining bonds.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 2.  A summary of hydrogen bonds formed between specific amino acids and organic compounds.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0004473.t002The distribution of occurrence of the hydrogen bonds with the organic compounds for the individual AAs is compared with the corresponding results obtained for protein-DNA interactions, which were derived based on 129 protein-DNA complexes [5], see Table 2. In both cases, the distributions are similar, i.e., Arg, Lys, Ser, Thr, and Asn establish the largest number of hydrogen bonds with both the organic compounds and the DNA molecules, while Phe, Met, Cys, and Pro establish the smallest number of hydrogen bonds with both types of ligands. The two AAs that establish the highest number of hydrogen bonds, Arg and Lys, are characterized by a larger relative number of bonds in the case of the binding with DNA, although we emphasize that the order of AAs in both cases is consistent. This suggests that the ability of AAs to establish hydrogen bonds could be an intrinsic characteristic of the AA itself, which is independent of the type of the ligand.\nThe negatively charged residues Asp and Glu did not exhibit strong affinity towards establishing hydrogen bonds in spite of having relatively high solvent accessibility and inclusion of two oxygen atoms in their side chains. We observe that Asp and Glu form the largest number of hydrogen bonds (278 and 300) when the AA serves as acceptor. At the same time they form only 103 and 53 hydrogen bonds when they serve as donors, which is relatively small when contrasted with the number of hydrogen bonds formed by other hydrophilic residues, e.g., 1555 for Arg and 802 for Lys. This low affinity to form hydrogen bonds could be explained by considering that the carboxyl groups of Asp and Glu often lend their H+ to solution, and as a result the two oxygen atoms on the carboxyl group are not bonded to hydrogen atom and cannot serve as donor when forming the hydrogen bond.\nThe most frequently formed hydrogen bond is established between NH- group (as the donor) of an AA and the oxygen atom of an organic compound. This type of the hydrogen bond covers 5206/7914 = 65.8% of all hydrogen bonds. To compare, the NH- group of organic compound serving as the donor and the oxygen atom of AAs account for only 325 hydrogen bonds. The surface patch that is characteristic for NH- group has high potential to form hydrogen bonds with organic compounds. For instance, in the chain A of neuraminidase protein (PDB entry 1F8E) [27], the pocket that binds 4,9-AMINO-2,4-DEOXY-2,3-DEHYDRO-N-ACETYL​-NEURAMINIC(abbreviated to 49A in PDB) includes 4 Arg residues, i.e., Arg118, Arg152, Arg292, and Arg371, see Figure 3. Three of them, Arg118, Arg292, and Arg371, are spatially adjacent and they form 5 hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atoms of 49A, while the other residues in the pocket establish only 2 hydrogen bonds. The cluster of the five hydrogen bonds is crucial for the interaction between the protein chain and the compound.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 3.

The residues in the pocket are in ball and stick format while the ligand is in stick format. Hydrogen bonds are represented by “…”. The structure is taken from chain A of neuraminidase protein (PDB entry 1F8E), which interacts with 49A. The binding pocket contains four Arg residues and each residue contains 2 NH- groups. Three Arg residues (Arg118, Arg292, Arg371) are spatially adjacent, and they form five hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atoms of the ligand.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0004473.g003\nVan der Waals contact.Majority of the van der Waals contacts are formed between carbon, oxygen and nitrogen atoms. These three atoms result in nine potential combinations which cover 94.8% of all van der Waals contacts between proteins and organic compounds. The most common van der Waals contacts are established between carbon atom of a residue and carbon atom of a compound, and carbon atom of a residue and oxygen atom of a compound. Each of the above two cases accounts for more than 25% of all van der Waals contacts. In contrast with the covalent and hydrogen bonds, van der Waals contacts are irregular and lack frequently occurring patterns that would indicate involvement of particular residues.\n\n\n\nInteraction patterns in protein-metal ion complexes\nAmong 1682 protein-metal ion complexes, 639 involve both coordination bonds and electrostatic force, 459 are based on electrostatic force but with no coordination bonds, and 499 incorporate coordination bonds with no electrostatic force. Overall, electrostatic force and coordination bonds are involved in (639+459+499) = 1597 complexes, which corresponds to 1597/1682 = 94.9% of all protein-metal ion complexes.\nAsp and Glu residues are negatively charged and could potentially form electrostatic contact with the metal ions. Since the charge is not evenly distributed over the AAs, we analyzed which non-hydrogen atom of Asp/Glu is the closest to the metal ions. Among 1098 complexes involved the electrostatic force, metal ions formed electrostatic interaction with Asp and Glu 1511 times (in some complexes more than 1 electrostatic interaction is formed). In the case of 1385 out of above 1511 interactions, the oxygen atoms of the carboxyl group of Asp and Glu are the closest to the metal ion. This suggests that these two oxygen atoms could be more negatively charged than other atoms in the side chains.\nMetal ions were observed to form coordination bonds with up to 6 atoms of a given protein, i.e., in chain A of 4-chlorobenzoyl coenzyme A dehalogenase protein (PDB entry 1NZY) [28], the calcium ion is coordinated with oxygen atoms of Gly49, Leu202, Ala203, Ala205, Thr207 and Gln210. On the other hand, some metal ions form coordination bonds with just one atom, i.e., in the chain A of human sex hormone-binding globulin protein (PDB entry 1D2S) [29], the calcium ion interacts only with His136. Total of 2345 coordination bonds are formed among the 1138 protein-metal ion complexes that involve this type of bond. The nitrogen atom in the side chain of His forms 787 bonds with the coordinating metal ions, sulfur atom of Cys forms 434 coordination bonds with metal ions, and oxygen atom (of any AA except Asp/Glu since interaction between metal ion and Asp/Glu is considered to be based on the electrostatic force) forms 1039 coordination bonds. The bonds based on these three atoms correspond to (787+434+1039)/2345 = 96.4% of all coordination bonds. The strong affinity of the oxygen to form coordination bonds with metal ion suggests that the interaction between the negatively charged Asp and Glu residues and metal ions could be a combination of both the coordination and the electrostatic force. The interaction between metal ions and Asp/Glu has been considered as coordination in many other studies. For instance, Angkawidjaja and colleagues reported that Ca2+ is coordinated by the side chains of Asp153, Asp157, and Gln120, and the carbonyl oxygens of Thr118 and Ser144 [30]; similarly, Declercq and coworkers show interaction between Ca2+ and the coordinating oxygen atoms of Asp51, Asp53, Ser55, Phe57, Glu59 and Glu62 [31]. As a result, the interactions between metal ions and Asp/Glu should be regarded as both coordination and electrostatic contacts if the distance between the corresponding atoms satisfies the definition of the coordination bond and the electrostatic contact.\nAlthough the generic principles that govern protein-metal ion interactions were discussed in prior works [9]–[12], e.g., interactions concerning Cys-rich Zn2+-binding sites and affinity of interaction between Mg2+ and Asp/Glu in protein cavities [9], we could not find a systematic study that investigates how many residues and what residues types are involved (“preferred”) in the coordination bonds with specific metal ions, and that provides insights concerning similarities in the geometry of the coordination-based interactions with metal ions, which are discussed below.\nAmong the metal ions, Ag+, Ca2+, Cu2+(Cu+), Cd2+, Co2+(Co+), Fe3+(Fe2+), Hg2+, K+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Na+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Sm2+ and Zn2+ form coordination bonds with atoms of residues, see Table 3. Zn2+ forms coordination bonds in the largest number of pockets. This ion is coordinated by atoms of at most 4 residues in a given pocket and it favors to be coordinated by 3 or 4 residues. The second highest number of pockets that involve coordination bonds with a metal ion concerns Ca2+. These ions are coordinated by atoms of up to six residues in a pocket, and they prefer to form the coordination bonds with 4 or 5 residues. Coordination bonds with Mg2+ and Cd2+ ions involve 228 and 109 pockets, respectively. In contrast to Zn2+ and Ca2+, Mg2+ and Cd2+ ions form most of these bonds with atoms of 1 or 2 residues in a given pocket. Na+ ions form coordination bonds in 150 pockets and it favors to be coordinated by atoms of 3 or fewer residues. These 5 ions form coordination bonds in (426+328+228+109+150) = 1241 pockets, which constitutes 1241/1542 = 80.5% of all relevant pockets. The above results suggest that different metal ions prefer to be coordinated by a different number of residues in a given protein pocket.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 3.

We count the frequencies of the residue groups among different metal ions. For instance, given that Zn2+ forms coordination bonds with 4 Cys residues in 47 pockets, the corresponding frequency of (Cys)4 residue group is 47. The residue groups that are coordinated by at least 10 metal ions are shown in Figures 4, 5 and 6. The frequencies of residue groups that contain 5 or more residues are below 10 and thus they are not included in the above Figures. Total of 5 residue groups, i.e., (Cys)4, (Cys)3(His), (Cys)2(His)2, (Asp)2(His)2, and (Asp)(His)3, include 4 residues, see Figure 4. We observe that the (Cys)4 group is coordinated by the largest number of metal ions (47 metal ions). There are 11 residue groups that incorporate 3 residues, see Figure 5. These groups include (Cys)3, (Cys)1(His)2, (Asp)3, (Asp)2(Glu), (Asp)2(His), (Asp)(Glu)2, (Asp)(Glu)(His), (Asp)(His)2, (Glu)2(His), (Glu)(His)2 and (His)3.

The residue groups that are coordinated by at least 10 metal ions and consist of 2 residues.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0004473.g006Cys and His are among the residues that the most frequently form coordination bonds with the metal ions. We observe that although the geometry of (Cys)4–metal ion and (His)3-metal ion interactions is different, each of these residue groups has similar geometry across the set of the corresponding pockets. The prevalent way to form the coordination bond between Cys and a metal ion involves four Cys residues arranged spatially close to each other to form a pocket; the metal ion is located in the center of this pocket. For example, in the chain A of PHD finger protein 21A (PDB entry 2PUY) [32], the zinc ion forms coordination bonds with Cys503, Cys506, Cys529, and Cys532. The distance between zinc ion and the sulfur atom of the four Cys residues varies between 2.26 Å and 2.41 Å. The four sulfur atoms form an approximate regular tetrahedron and the zinc ion is located in its center, see Figure 7A. The length of the tetrahedron edges varies between 3.63 Å and 3.93 Å. The coordination interaction between His and metal involves three His residues arranged to form a pocket with the metal ion located in approximately the same distance to the nitrogen atoms of these three residues. For example, in the chain A of Zn-dependent hydrolase protein (PDB entry 2R2D) [33], the zinc ion forms coordination bonds with nitrogen atoms of His111, His113, and His191. The distance between the zinc ion and the nitrogen atoms varies between 2.06 Å and 2.18 Å, see Figure 7B. The three nitrogen atoms form an approximate equilateral triangle with the length of the sides that varies between 3.14 Å and 3.31Å.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 7.

The zinc ion is not located on the triangle plane.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0004473.g007Metal ion-residue coordination plays a crucial role in stabilizing the protein structure and is involved in a number of catalytic activities [34]–[37]. Traoré's study reveals that the Zn(Cys)4 site locks the dimerization domain and stabilizes the dimer of protein PerR [34]. Ochiai and colleagues show that a calcium ion coordinated by Asp401, Glu422, His363, and His399 is required for the enzyme activity of rhamnogalacturonan lyase YesW [38]. Sankaranarayanan and colleagues point out that a zinc ion is directly involved in threonine recognition, forming a pentacoordinate intermediate with both the amino group and the side chain hydroxyl and mediated AA discrimination by threonyl-tRNA synthetase [39]. Covarrubias and coworkers demonstrate that depletion of a zinc ion, which is coordinated with aspartic acid side chain, leads to the lack of activity of Rv1284 gene [40]. The above example studies demonstrate the important role of metal ions in assisting protein folding and in catalysis of chemical reactions.\n\n\nInteraction patterns in protein-inorganic anion complexes\nInorganic anions bind to proteins mainly through electrostatic force, hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts. Among the 1837 anions, 1188 interact with the positively charged AAs such as Arg, His and Lys based on electrostatic interaction and 641 bind to the pocket by the means of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts.\nSimilarly as in the case of metal ions, we studied which atoms of the positively charged residues are the closest to the inorganic anions. Among the 1188 protein-anion complexes that involve electrostatic force, 202 anions bind to His, 327 to Lys, and 659 to Arg. Nitrogen atom in the side chain of these three residues is the closest atom to the anion for 172 anion-His interactions, 222 anion-Lys interactions, and 565 anion-Arg interactions. These numbers suggest that the nitrogen atoms of positively charged residues may be closer to the center of the charge than other non-hydrogen atoms.\nAmong the anions that occur in PDB more than 100 times, 743 SO42− (743/948 = 78.5%) and 109 PO43− (109/148 = 73.6%) bind to positively charged residues, while some other anions less frequently bind with the charged residues. More specifically, 165 Cl− (165/345 = 47.8%), 33 Br− (33/126 = 26.2%), and 22 I− (22/108 = 20.4%) bind to positively charged residue. This could be explained based on the formation of hydrogen bonds between the oxygen atoms of SO42− and PO43− and the NH- group of positively charge residues. For instance, PO43− forms 254 hydrogen bonds with positively charge residues (254/109 = 2.3 hydrogen bonds per pocket) and SO42− forms 1394 hydrogen bonds with positively charge residues (1394/743 = 1.9 hydrogen bonds per pocket). The combination of electrostatic force and hydrogen bonds stabilizes the anion-positively charged residue interaction.\nSimilarly to the protein-organic compound complexes, the most frequent hydrogen bond incorporates the NH- group of a residue that serves as the donor and the oxygen atom of a ligand. This pattern concerns 2777 hydrogen bonds which converts into 2777/3190 = 87.1% of all hydrogen bonds between a protein pocket and an inorganic anion.\n\n\nInteraction patterns in protein-inorganic cluster complexes\nAmidst the nine types of inorganic cluster that could be found in PDB, FS4, FES, SF4, F3S, CLF, and FS3 are Fe-S clusters and contain only iron and sulfur atoms. The remaining three clusters, which include CFN, FSO, and NFS, also mainly contain iron and sulfur atoms.\nWe observe that coordination bonds are involved in all 54 protein-inorganic cluster complexes. These bonds are usually formed between the iron atom of the cluster and the sulfur atom of Cys residue, and the iron atom of the cluster and the nitrogen atom in the side chain of His residue. These two coordination bond patterns cover 201/204 = 98.5% of all coordination bonds between inorganic cluster and a protein pocket. Although FS4, SF4, F3S, and FS3 are positively charged and FSO is negatively charged, these clusters do not interact with charged residues. We did not find the electrostatic force based interactions between the inorganic clusters and proteins.\n\n\nComparison between protein-protein interaction interfaces and protein-organic compound binding pockets\nSeveral statistical studies have investigated the AA frequencies and the pairing preference for the protein-protein interaction interface. Ben-Tal's study indicates the hydrophobic residues are abundant in large interfaces while polar residues are more abundant in small interfaces [41]. They also conclude that contacts between pairs of hydrophobic and polar residues are unfavorable and that the charged residues tend to pair subject to charge complementarity. This conclusion was confirmed in a more recent study by Helms and colleagues [42].\nSince proteins and small organic compounds share similar chemical composition, we examined similarities and difference between AA composition of protein-organic compound binding pockets and protein-protein interaction interfaces, see Figure 8. The AA composition of protein-protein interaction interfaces (gray bars) is taken from [42], where it was calculated based on a non-redundant set of 170 protein-protein complexes. We note that except for Cys, which occurs twice as often in the protein-protein interaction interfaces when compared with the protein-organic compound binding pocket (3.1% vs. 1.5%), other AAs occur with similar frequency for both types of interactions. This similarity indicates that protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions could be determined by same types of forces and thus current protein-ligand docking techniques could be potentially adopted for protein-protein docking.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 8.  Percentage of occurrence of amino acids in the protein-organic compound binding pockets (gray bar) and in protein-protein interaction interfaces (black bar).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0004473.g008\n\nOverlap and coverage of the interaction patterns\nThe 11 patterns that concern covalent bonds, coordination bonds and hydrogen bonds, see the bottom layer in Figure 1, appear in 2013 protein-organic compound complexes, 1138 protein-metal ion complexes, 1115 protein-anion complexes, and 53 protein-inorganic cluster complexes, which corresponds to (2013+1138+1115+53)/7759 = 55.7% of all protein-ligand complexes. Significant majority of the above complexes incorporates just one of the discussed patterns. More specifically, except for 81 protein-organic compound complexes and 546 protein-metal ion complexes that incorporate two or more interaction patterns, the remaining 4238 protein-ligand complexes include one interaction pattern.\n\n\nPrediction of binding sites of organic compounds based on interaction patterns\nWe show the utility of the discussed patterns in the context of the blind (without the knowledge of the ligand) prediction of binding sites. Since organic compounds are the largest group among the four considered types of ligands and since majority of the oral drugs are based on the organic compounds, we design and test a naïve method to predict the binding sites for the organic compounds that utilizes the knowledge of the four corresponding interaction patterns shown in Figure 1. The predictions are made using a dataset that consists of 901 proteins that was introduced in [43], in which the pairwise sequence identity is below 35%. Over 90% of these chains interact with only one organic compound, and the remaining chains interact with 2 or 3 compounds. Other types of ligands, e.g., metal ions, may bind to some of the chains, however, the binding sites of these ligands are not considered.\nThe prediction procedure follows a sequence of three steps:\n\n\n\n\nCalculate a grid encompassing the protein structure using the LigsiteCSC program [44]. The grid points are divided into those that are inside the protein structure, on the surface, and in the solvent [44]. We only use the solvent grid points.\n\nScan the solvent grid points that are within 5Å from the protein surface and count the interaction patterns that are within R distance from a given grid point. Only the atoms on the protein surface are considered. The interaction patterns for organic compounds include hydrogen bond (formed between NH- group of residue and oxygen atom of ligand) and covalent bonds. The actual counts of the hydrogen bonds and covalent bonds cannot be computed since this is a blind prediction. Instead, we count NH- group within the R radius to reflect potential hydrogen bonds. For the covalent bonds, we count sulfur atoms to reflect potential thioether and disulfide bonds.\n\nSort the grid points in the descending order based on the computed counts. The first prediction corresponds to the top scoring grid point. The subsequent predictions correspond to the points with the largest scores which are at least 5Å away from any accepted prediction.\n\nThe predictions are evaluated based on the distance between the predicted site and the actual position of the ligand, i.e., a prediction is assumed correct if the distance is smaller than a cut-off threshold value, which is varied between 1 and 10Å. For a given protein structure, 5 potential binding sites are predicted, which follows the procedure performed in relevant recent studies [44]. More specifically, if any of the 5 predicted binding sites is less than a certain distance (D) from any atom of the ligand, the prediction for this protein is assumed correct. This is motivated by the fact that the input dataset provides incomplete information, i.e., some actual binding sites could be missing which implies that some predictions that are far from the ligands included in the dataset could be potentially correct. The success rate is defined as the number of the correctly predicted proteins divided by size of the dataset.\nThe pattern-based method is compared with LigsiteCSC that identifies pockets on the protein surface based on a geometrical analysis [44], and which extends Ligsite method [45]. LigsiteCSC is shown to perform comparably well or better when compared with several other binding site predictors such as Ligsite, CAST, PASS, and SURFNET [44]. We also implemented a baseline predictor by random selection of five solvent grid points that are less than 5Å from the protein surface. Two versions of our scanning-based approach are considered, one that uses both hydrogen and covalent bonds patterns, and the other that uses only the hydrogen bond pattern. The radius R is set to 8Å since for this value 1%–5% higher success rate is achieved when compared with other values between 5 and 10Å. Figure 9 compares the predictions. The naïve method based on the interaction patterns is inferior to Ligsite CSC, i.e., our success rate is about 10% lower than that of Ligsite CSC for D = 2 to D = 10. This is not surprising since the four interaction patterns do not cover all protein-organic compound interactions as discussed above and since 29% of the organic compounds bind to protein only through van der Waals contacts. We observe that both methods are superior to the random predictions. We also observe that adding the patterns concerning covalent bonds improves the success rates by 1 to 2% across different D values, which shows that combining multiple patterns is helpful. This improvement is due to the inclusion of thiol of Cys, which potentially forms thioether and disulfide bonds.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 9.  Performance of blind binding site predictors including the pattern-based method, LigsiteCSC, and a random baseline predictor.The y axis shows success rate, i.e., fraction of proteins with minimum distance between the top five predicted binding sites and any atom of a ligand in the native complex that is smaller or equal to the distance displayed on the x axis. The five plots concern the scanning method based solely on the hydrogen bond pattern (named “Scanning (hydrogen)”), the scanning method based on the four patterns concerning both hydrogen and covalent bonds (named “Scanning (hydrogen&covalent)”), the result of LigsiteCSC, the result of baseline method that randomly picks 5 solvent grid points that are within 5Å from the protein surface (named “Random baseline”), and the results that merge the top two predictions of LigsiteCSC and the top three predictions of the scanning method that uses the four patterns (named “Scanning/Ligsite-csc hybrid”).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0004473.g009We observe that the prediction from the pattern-based method are complementary to the prediction from Ligsite CSC, i.e., for some proteins the binding sites predicted by Ligsite CSC are relatively far away from the actual binding sites while our method provides correct predictions. For example, for the Anguilla anguilla agglutinin protein (PDB entry 1K12), the 5 prediction generated by Ligsite CSC are at least 11 Å away from the ligand, while one of our predictions is only 0.67Å from the compound, see Figure 10. This motivated a hybrid approach in which predictions from the two methods are combined by taking the top two predictions from LigsiteCSC and the top three pattern-based predictions (on average the third best pattern-based prediction is better than third best prediction from LigsiteCSC). Figure 9 shows that the results based on the merged predictions are better than the results from individual methods, especially for low values of D. For instance, in the case of D = 1, both Ligsite CSC and pattern-based methods predict the binding sites that are within 1Å from the ligand for about 35% of the proteins, while the merged predictions are successful at 46% level. This result indicates that interaction patterns could be utilized to improve existing blind geometrical predictions of binding sites.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 10.

This study presents and investigates several frequently occurring interaction patterns for atomic-level protein-ligand interactions. The considered protein pocket-ligand complexes were grouped into four categories: protein-organic compound, protein-metal ion, protein-anion, and protein-inorganic cluster complexes. These groups cover 93.5% of all protein-ligand complexes from PDB and we show that they are governed by different types of interaction forces. The protein-organic compound complexes are governed by the hydrogen bonds, van der Waals contacts and covalent bond. The protein-metal ion complexes are based on the electrostatic force and coordination bonds while the protein-anion complexes are governed by the electrostatic force, hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts. Finally, the protein-inorganic cluster complexes are established mostly due to the coordination bonds.We present several frequently occurring interaction patterns, defined in terms of prevalent interactions between specific atoms of specific residue in the protein's pocket and specific atoms of the ligand, for the abovementioned four groups and for the specific types of interaction forces. We quantify relative abundance of specific interaction types and discuss their characteristic features such as commonly interacting amino acid types. Total of 10 interaction patterns that occur in 56% of all considered complexes were found. For example, we show that 66.9% of the protein-organic compound complexes involve hydrogen bonds and that 65.8% of these hydrogen bonds are formed between the NH- group of the protein's residue and the oxygen atom of the organic compound. As a result, we believe that the geometric and electrostatic complementary, which are used for molecular recognition, should be supplemented by implementation of hydrogen bond(s) in the case of the protein-organic compound complexes. As another example, only four interaction patterns are sufficient to summarize significant majority, i.e., 73%, of normal covalent bond interactions between proteins and ligands; they include the covalent bond between the thiol of Cys residue and the carbon atom of the ligand (thioether bond), the thiol of Cys residue and the sulfur atom of the ligand (disulfide bond), and the nitrogen atom of Lys residue and the carbon atom of the ligand. We also show that the AAs serve as donors for significant majority of these hydrogen bonds. We observe that most of the inorganic anions interact with positively charged AAs including Arg, His, and Lys.We show that the organic compounds form hydrogen bonds more frequently with hydrophilic AAs when compared with hydrophobic AAs, which is consistent with results obtained for protein-DNA interactions [5]. This suggests that the ability of AAs to establish hydrogen bonds could be an intrinsic characteristic of a given AA, which is independent of the ligand type. We also found that protein-organic compound binding pockets and protein-protein interaction interfaces share similar AA composition, which may imply that these interactions are determined by the same types of forces.We also demonstrate a practical application of the abovementioned patterns in the context of blind prediction of binding sites for organic compounds. Our analysis reveals that a scanning method based on simple counts of the occurrence of the patterns provides predictions that complement existing methods that are based on the geometrical analysis of the protein surface.To conclude, we show that for a given type (group) of ligands and a given type of the interaction force, majority of protein-ligand interactions are repetitive and could be summarized with several simple atomic-level patterns. These interaction patterns not only provide a comprehensive overview of protein-ligand interactions, but they also may have profound implications for development of molecular docking procedures and in building of binding site prediction methods."

                "\nMass spectrometry is a valuable tool for the analysis and identification of chemical compounds, particularly proteins and peptides. Lichenysins G, the major cyclic lipopeptide of lichenysin, and the non-covalent complex of lichenysins G and 4-ethylguaiacol were investigated with negative ion ESI tandem mass spectrometry. The different fragmentation mechanisms for these compounds were investigated. Our study shows the 4-ethylguaiacol hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of the ester group in the loop of lichenysins G. With the help of this hydrogen bond interaction, the ring structure preferentially opens in lactone linkage rather than O-C bond of the ester-group to produce alcohol and ketene. Isothermal titration 1H-NMR analysis verified the hydrogen bond and determined the proportion of subject and ligand in the non-covalent complex to be 1∶1. Theoretical calculations also suggest that the addition of the ligand can affect the energy of the transition structures (TS) during loop opening.\n"

            "fulltext": "IntroductionRapid developments and technological advances in the field of mass spectrometry have made electrospray ionization (ESI)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) a powerful tool for the analysis of peptides and proteins [1]–[2] with the capability to routinely identify sequences of tens of thousands of proteins [3]–[4]. Most analyses were performed using positive ion mode because the ionization of peptides and proteins in negative ion mode is relatively limited [5]. However experiments in negative ionization mode can also reveal important information in the investigation of peptide and protein structure and function [6]. Hydrophobic amide groups are typically positioned at the C-termini of peptides and are thought to be the key binding sites for biological activity. Negative ion mode can be used to more easily distinguish these amide groups as they are easily deprotonated [8]. Several works have been reported that utilized negative ion mode to study drugs, peptides, and proteins [7]–[8]. Cassady observed different fragmentation patterns in negative ion mode between nearly identical peptides which can provide insight into the structure of the peptides and improved identification of unknown peptides [9]. Moore utilized negative ion mode to investigate the fragmentation chemistry of anionic, hydrogen-deficient and radical peptides [10].\nMicroorganisms are known to produce peptides, especially cyclic peptides, with diverse biological activities that are of great interest to researchers in many fields. These peptides are produced from endophytic organisms, bacteria, and fungi [11]–[12]. The cyclic peptides of interest are formed via reactions with an ester group or a disulfide bond [13]–[14]. Studying the cleavage of cyclic peptides can help to elucidate their structure and function in microorganisms.\nSurfactin is a bacterial cyclic lipopeptide produced by the Gram-positive, endospore-forming bacteria, Bacillus subtilis. It contains a heptapeptide with a hydrolysable ester linkage and a variable aliphatic chain of 13–15 carbon atoms. Because of its amphiphilic properties, which allow it to be stable in both hydrophilic and hydrophobic environments, surfactin is commonly used as an antibiotic. Previous studies reported that surfatin exhibits effective anti-tumour, anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activity [15]–[17]. The lichenysin and four homolog compounds produced by Bacillus licheniformis are cyclic lipopeptides in the surfactin family. The primary homolog, lichenysins G (MW 1035 Da), contains the previously mentioned heptapeptide and an aliphatic chain of 15 carbon atoms, which is shown in Figure 1a.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.  (a) lichensins G 1035 Da, (b) 4-ethyl guaiacol.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0104835.g001Mass spectrometry is a powerful technique for the study of cyclic lipopeptide structure and function. Pathak used HPLC coupled to ESI-MS to identify several new fengcin variants and also found four major sites of heterogeneity between them [18]. Samgina utilized collision-induced dissociation (CID) to elucidate the sequences of natural, non-tryptic peptides with C-terminal disulfide cycle [19]. Using mass spectrometry to study non-covalent complexes of peptides and ligands can reveal peptide cleavage sites. O'Hair used mass spectrometry to investigate the gas phase chemistry of proton bound oligosaccharide (S) –ligand (L) non-covalent complexes and found that a ladder series is produced by ligand induced oligosaccharide bond cleavage [20].\nIn this work, lichenysins G, the predominant lichenysin homolog, was selected as the model to investigate the fragmentation mechanism using negative ion tandem mass spectrometry. 4-ethylguaiacol, an important pharmaceutical intermediate, was added as the ligand and the structure is shown in Figure 1b. By comparing the different fragmentation of the lichenysins G and the non-covalent complex of lichenysins G and 4-ethylguaiacol, the detail of the interaction between this two compounds and the effects on fragmentation of lichenysins G induced by the ligand are expounded. The existing work [21]–[23] helping to propose the fragmentation mechanism and theoretical calculations were used to support the proposed mechanism.\nExperimental\nMaterials\nThe four lichenysin targets (purity >90% by MS analysis) were provided by the School of Biotechnology, Jiangnan University. 4-ethylguaiacol (purity >95% by LC-MS analysis) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.\n\n\nMass Spectrometry\nAll CID experiments were performed on a Bruker AmaZon ETD mass spectrometer (Bruker-Franzen Analytik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a nanospray ionization source and an ion trap mass analyzer using negative ion mode. Nitrogen was used as nebulizing gas at a pressure of 10 psi and drying gas at a flow rate of 5 L·min−1. The drying gas temperature was 250°C and the capillary voltage was 4000 V. Samples were dissolved in acetonitrile/1% salicylic acid solution 99.9/0.1 (v:v) to form a 1×10−8 mol·L−1 and infused to the mass spectrometer with a syringe pump at a flow rate of 3 uL·min−1. The CID mass spectra were obtained with helium as the collision gas at suitable collision energy after isolation of the desired precursor ion. The mass window for precursor ion selection was between 0.8 and 1.0 m/z to ensure 13C isotopic ions were excluded. Data were acquired using the software Esquire 5.0 (Bruker).\n\n\nNMR Analysis\n1H NMR and 2D NOESY experiments were carried out using a Bruker AMX 500 MHz instrument at 298 K with samples in d-DMSO. Typical parameters for 1H NMR experiments consisted of spectral width of 10 ppm, number of scans at 16 and relaxation delay at 1 s. 50–60° pulses with overall delay of 3 s between pulses were used. The time-domain data were exponentially multiplied before Fourier transformation with 0.0–0.5 Hz line broadening functions depending on the resulting S/N ratio of the spectrum. Tetramethylsilane (TMS) was used as internal reference for all spectra (0 ppm). For NOESY spectrum, the data was acquired with a mixing time of 60 ms and a relaxation delay at 2 s [24].\n\n\nTheoretical Calculations\nThe software program Amber was used to perform the conformational search of the non-covalent complex ion. Using molecular dynamics simulation of 100 ns, we divided the series of conformers into twenty groups and obtained twenty representative conformations. The global minimum energy of conformation was chosen by comparing all molecular dynamics simulation energy.\nPotential energy surfaces (PES) were also used to take into consideration the deprotonated lichenysins G and non-covalent complex. The candidate structures of the reactants, products, intermediates and transition states were optimized by calculating the force constants. Calculations were performed to modify the initial structures with a deprotonated carboxyl group and compare the 1, 3 hydrogen transition structure (TS) energy from either the alpha carbon or aliphatic carbon to the oxygen in the ester group. All theoretical calculations were carried out by using the ONIOM method at the B3LYP/6−311++G (d,p) level of theory and PM6 theory in the Gaussian 03 program. No symmetry constrains were imposed on the optimizations. All optimized structures were subjected to vibrational frequency analysis for zero-point energy (ZPE) correction. The sum of electronic and thermal energies of the optimized structures was discussed.\n\nResults and Discussion\nFragmentation of Lichenysins G and Non-covalent Complex\nThe parent ion shown in Figure 2(a) is the non-covalent 1:1 lichenysins G: 4-ethylguaiacol complex, [N-H]− (m/z 1186), and four characteristic fragments for the complex were observed: m/z 1016, 807, 710 and 692. And the Figure 2(b) exhibits the fragmentation of lichenysins G in negative ion mode. The fragmentation of the lichenysins G anion, [M-H]− (m/z 1034), resulted in three characteristic framents: m/z 1016, 794 and 692. In Table 1 which summarizes the primary fragments of M and N we can find the two targets have identical m/z values: m/z 1016 and m/z 692. Performing MS3 of m/z 1016 and m/z 692 can help determining whether these fragments with same molecular weight have the same molecular stucture. The results of MS3 are shown in Figure 3, Figure S1 in File S1 and Table 1. Figure 3(a) shows the MS3 fragmentation of m/z 1016 fragment from the non-covalent complex and Figure 3(b) shows the MS3 fragmentation of m/z 1016 fragment from lichenysins G, respectively. The primary MS3 fragments of 1016 for M are m/z 794 and 692, whereas the primary MS3 fragments of 1016 for N are m/z 807, 710 and 692. The different characteristic MS3 fragmentation patterns observed for M and N suggest that different molecular structures comprise the m/z 1016 MS2 fragment for each analyte. One the other hand, the MS3 fragmentaiton of m/z 692 fragments from N (Figure S1(a) in File S1) and M (Figure S1(b) in File S1) indicate that they have the same molecular structure because of their same fragmentations.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 2.

Main ions of every fragmentation of Cyclic Lipopetide and Non-covalent complex.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0104835.t001\n\nFragmentation Mechanisms of Lichenysins G and Non-covalent Complex\nFurther analysis of the MS3 fragmentation of these two m/z 1016 fragment ions from lichenysins G and non-covalent complex, can help elucidate the fragmentation mechanisms for each analyte. The specific cyclic structure of lichenysins G should be taken into consideration; therefore, the open loop of lichenysins G is hypothesized as the initial process of fragmentation.\nFigure 4 shows the pathways rationalizing the fragmentation of M in negative ion mode. At the beginning, the carboxyl of the Asp side chain loses a hydrogen forming the [M-H]− ion. Next the hydrogen from the methylene in the middle of aliphatic chain and carbonyl (colored in red), transfers to the oxygen of ester group via 1,3 hydrogen migration. Thereafter, the carbon (from aliphatic chain) - oxygen (from ester group) bond is broken, sequentially opening the loop and forming a carboxyl and ethylene at both ends respectively [24]–[28]. Finally, the compound, which loses water after ring opening, forms the [M-H-H2O]− (m/z 1016). The loss of water may have two possible pathways. One pathway could be that the tertiary amine of Leu attacks the carbon of the adjacent Asp carboxyl group to form a five-member ring. The hydrogen of the carboxyl group formed by the ring opening can transfer to the hydroxyl formed by the five-member ring as mobile proton, resulting in the water loss [29]–[33]. The second potential pathway is that the carboxyl formed by the ring opening can directly lose water and form the ketene. The first pathway is more probable and supports in the following pages.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 4.  The fragmentation mechanisms of lichenysins G.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0104835.g004Both MS2 of [M-H]− and MS3 of [M-H-H2O]− generate the fragment m/z 794, shown in Figure 2 and 3. The fragment ion m/z 794 is formed from the open ring structure of [M-H-H2O]−. The ring opening results in linear precursor ions, which undergo subsequent cleavages as shown in figure 4, and then creates a y7 ion which generated the m/z 794 by the neutral loss of an unsaturated ketene group. In addition, this fragmentation may continue and produce the y6 (m/z 666) and y5 (m/z 552) fragmentation ions by losing Gln and Leu respectively. The three fragments listed above can demonstrate that the ring is indeed open in the location of O-C bond between the ester group and aliphatic chain.\nFigure 4 also illustrates the mechanism pathway that rationalizes the neutral loss of m/z 342 from lichenysins G to form the m/z 692 ion. This process proceeds by the N-C bond dissociating from the amine and alpha carbon of the Asp side chain and produces the neutral loss of a tripeptide containing Asp, Leu and Ile. Moreover, the cleavage of the N-C bond rationalizes the mechanism of water loss described above, because the stable five-member ring facilitates the N-C bond dissociation.\nCompared to figure 4 there is prominent difference in the fragmentation mechanisms of [N-H]− in the way of open loop. It is suggests that the ligand has no direct participation in the fragmention of N from Figure 2 and 3 by means of determining all the fragmentations belong to the subject M. Figure 5 illustrates the pathway for formation of fragmentation ion m/z 1016. First the non-covalent complex may lose the neutral micromolecule ligand and next the hydrogen from alpha carbon of Ile transfers to the oxygen of ester group via 1,3 hydrogen migration. A cleavage occurs inside the lactone linkage forming a ketene and an alcohol. Finally the loop opening results in a loss of water and the formation of [N-H-ligand-H2O]− (m/z 1016). The water loss also proceeds by the nucleophilic attack of the Asp carboxyl carbon on the amidogen from the adjacent Leu, forming the five-member ring. The hydrogen of the alcohol formed during ring opening transfers to the hydroxyl formed by the five member ring as mobile proton resulting in the water loss.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 5.  The fragmentation mechanisms of non-covalent complex.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0104835.g005The ions with m/z 807 and 710 are the fragmentation products of linear precursor ions formed by ring opening. They also have a relationship with the formation of the five-member ring in Asp. When the N-C bond from the amine and alpha carbon of Leu is cleaved, the neutral dipeptide, containing Leu and Ile, may be lost forming the n5 ion with m/z 807. If the five-member ring in the Asp side chain is lost as well, the remaining product is the n4 ion with m/z 710. The n4 ion can easily lose water from the deprotonated alcohol in the terminal of aliphatic chain and form the ion with m/z 692 which is a fragment of [M-H]− shown above. The fragmentation mechanism for forming n5 is also supported by the MS3 results of the n5, which is shown in Figure 6. In this fragmentation the cleavage of the C-C bond in the linear aliphatic chain to lose the aliphatic ketone produce the the ion [y7-y2] (m/z 608) and continue losing the five-member ring of the Asp side chain to produce the ion [y7-y3+NH2] (m/z 511). These two ions are also found in the MS3 results of [N-H-ligand-H2O]− and support the structure of the n5 ion. In addition, the structure of n5 also can show the fragmentation mechanism of [N-H]− and the location of the loop opening.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 6.  The MS3 analysis and fragmentation mechanisms of n5 (m/z 807).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0104835.g006Through the comparative analysis of the different fragmentation mechanisms of lichenysins G and the non-covalent complex, we infer that the ring opening location of lichenysins G can exchange from oxygen and carbon in the aliphatic bond to the carbonyl and oxygen bond of the ester group caused by the effect of the micromolecule ligand. The linear product ion transfers from the carboxyl and ethylene to the ketene and alcohol. In addition, the effective interaction of the micromolecule ligand may be the hydrogen bond between the phenolic hydroxyl group in the ligand and the oxygen of ester group carbonyl in the lichenysins G.\n\n\n1H-NMR Analysis\nTo verify the ESI-MS result of the non-covalent complex, the types of interactions between lichenysins G and 4-ethylguaiacol were determined by 1H-NMR. The 1H-NMR spectroscopy of lichenysins G was in accordance with the literature [34]. Spectroscopic titration suggested that lichenysins G and 4-ethylguaiacol could form stable 1:1 complex. The αH on alpha-carbon of Ile (δ = 4.12 ppm) had a remarkable shift and change in peak shape. Additional evidence of such interaction was provided by 2D 1H-1H NOESY NMR spectroscopy. The NOE correlations (αH, Hi) between the H on alpha-carbon of Ile and the hydroxyl of 4-ethylguaiacol confirm the interaction (Figure 7, Figure S2 in File S1).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 7.  1H NMR spectra (400 MHz) of non-covalent complex lichenysins G:4-Ethyl Guaiacol in DMSO at 25°C; b) 4:1; c) 2:1; d) 1:1; e) 1:2.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0104835.g007\n\nTheoretical Calculations\nThe crystal structure of surfactin was used as the reference when performing the theoretical calculations of the lichenysins G, because the amino acid sequence and cis-trans structure of lichenysins G are similar to surfactin. Molecular dynamics simulations of the hydrogen bond interaction between lichenysins G and the ligand provided a steady dynamic conformation (Figure 8).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 8.  The dynamic conformation of lichenysins G and ligand.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0104835.g008The mechanisms were further explored via theoretical calculations at an ONIOM level of theory. Figure 9 shows that the ligand and the ester group where hydrogen transfer and loop opening occur were approached as the nucleus and used RB3LYP/6−311++G(d,p) level of theory. The rest of the peptide was treated as a periphery region and treated with PM6 level of theory. When the ligand did not participate, the individual lichenysins G was optimized as the potential energy zero. The transition state energy of 1,3 hydrogen migration of the methylene hydrogen in the middle of aliphatic chain carbonyl to the oxygen of ester group (TS1-1) is 56.09 kcal/mol, 25.53 kcal/mol less than the transition state energy of 1,3 hydrogen migration of the alpha-carbon hydrogen of Ile to the oxygen of the ester group (TS1-2, 81.62 kcal/mol) (Table S1 in File S1). This result confirms the fragmentation mechanism of ring opening without the ligand. However, with the hydrogen bond interaction of the ligand, the transition state energy of 1,3 hydrogen migration of the alpha-carbon hydrogen of Ile to the oxygen of the ester group (TS2-2) prominently decreases to 76.76 kcal/mol but the transition state energy of 1,3 hydrogen migration of the methylene hydrogen in the middle of aliphatic chain carbonyl to the oxygen of ester group (TS2-1) was not founded. We observed that the conformation of TS2-1 changed back to the reactant structure when calculating the transfer structure. This could potentially be because the hydrogen bond interaction stabilizes the C-O bond of TS2-1 and makes the C-O bond of TS2-2 easier to cleave. Therefore this result supports the open-loop mechanism of the non-covalent complex.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 9.

The hydrogen bond between phenol hydroxyl of the ligand and the carbonyl oxygen of the ester group in the cyclic lipopeptide ring, which was confirmed by NMR, can promote cleavage of the C-O bond of the ester group, resulting in loop opening and ketene and alcohol generation. However with the absence of the hydrogen bond effect, the location of the loop opening of cyclic lipopeptide changes to the O-C bond beside the ester group, producing ethane and a carboxyl as reported in the literature. Molecular dynamics simulation supplies further evidence that there is a stabilized hydrogen bond and the potential energy surface calculations for the hydrogen translation structures energy also support the fragmentation mechanism of the non-covalent complex. The results of this work can provide the theoretical support for the research of metabolites with diverse biological activities produced from endophytic organisms.The online version of this article contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."

At the hot spring known as Bison Pool in Yellowstone National Park, the cooling of the water in the outflow channel is associated with an increase in oxidation potential estimated from multiple field-based measurements. Representative groups of proteins whose sequences were derived from metagenomic data also exhibit an increase in average oxidation state of carbon in the protein molecules with distance from the hot-spring source. The energetic requirements of reactions to form selected proteins used in the model were computed using amino-acid group additivity for the standard molal thermodynamic properties of the proteins, and the relative chemical stabilities of the proteins were investigated by varying temperature, pH and oxidation state, expressed as activity of dissolved hydrogen. The relative stabilities of the proteins were found to track the locations of the sampling sites when the calculations included a function for hydrogen activity that increases with temperature and is higher, or more reducing, than values consistent with measurements of dissolved oxygen, sulfide and oxidation-reduction potential in the field. These findings imply that spatial patterns in the amino acid compositions of proteins can be linked, through energetics of overall chemical reactions representing the formation of the proteins, to the environmental conditions at this hot spring, even if microbial cells maintain considerably different internal conditions. Further applications of the thermodynamic calculations are possible for other natural microbial ecosystems.\n      "

            "fulltext": "IntroductionThe imprints of distinct geochemical environments can be found in the molecular compositions of microbial genomes and their protein products. For example, transmembrane proteins of ancestral organisms were likely to be depleted in oxygen, paralleling the low oxygen content of Earth's atmosphere in the past [1]. Environmental imprints on proteins can also be found for spatially separated organisms living contemporaneously; the amino acid composition of proteins differ systematically between organisms living at different temperatures [2], [3]. Together with temperature, the chemical properties of the environment are linked to the compositions of gene sequences in hot-spring microbial communities [4], [5].\nAlthough the sequences of proteins must satisfy a complex array of biological requirements, the different biosynthetic costs of amino acids are viewed as one contributing factor to actual patterns of amino acid usage [6], [7]. In some studies, the biosynthetic costs of amino acids have been estimated from metabolic constraints including numbers of phosphate bonds and hydrogen atoms transferred during synthesis from precursors [6], [8]. Those estimates depend on the growth medium and specific metabolic pathways but otherwise do not involve environmental variables such as temperature and oxidation-reduction conditions. Nevertheless, it can be shown that the Gibbs energy change in overall chemical reactions to synthesize amino acids from from inorganic species depends on environmental conditions [9]. The calculations of energetics of overall synthesis reactions can now be done for proteins, where group additivity methods permit assessing standard Gibbs energies of proteins of any amino acid composition [10], [11].\nThe goal of this study is to use thermodynamic tools to characterize simultaneously the chemical environment and metagenomically derived protein sequences in a hot spring exhibiting large gradients of temperature and oxidation-reduction, or redox, chemistry. The geochemical and biomolecular data are combined using a single model framework based on chemical reactions and their energy changes. The use of a metagenomic dataset in a location where extensive geochemical data are available permits calibration and testing of the model.\nOne setting where in-depth metagenomic and geochemical information are available is the hot spring known as “Bison Pool”, a flowing, moderately alkaline hot spring in Yellowstone National Park [12], [13]. The water at the source is boiling, and rapidly cools along the outflow channel as a result of exposure to the ambient conditions. Extensive chemical analysis of the water also reveals large gradients of chemical composition such as increase in pH, decrease in sulfide concentration, increase in dissolved oxygen and in oxidation-reduction potential of the water. Prior metagenomic sampling of the microbial communities at five sites from the source to approximately 22 meters down the outflow channel offers a window into the biomolecular composition of these communities. Although the metagenomic sequencing is of the DNA molecules, genes present in the metagenome provide a picture of the proteins that are likely to be used by the organisms.\nThe first major theme of this study concerns the changes in chemical composition of proteins along the outflow channel. The stoichiometric quantity we investigate is the average oxidation state of carbon in the proteins, which can be calculated directly from the chemical formulas of the proteins. In general, the average oxidation state of carbon in proteins increases down the outflow channel. This effect is present at the level of the whole metagenome and also within different functional classes of proteins. There is a positive correlation between the average oxidation state of carbon in proteins and the oxidation-reduction potential of the surrounding water.\nThe results of the stoichiometric calculations support a hypothesis that chemical compositions of the proteins reflect processes that tend to minimize the free energy of the system. We applied thermodynamic models to integrate molecular composition with temperature and multiple environmental chemical variables. The second major theme of the paper addresses the relative stabilities of the different classes of model proteins from each sampling site in terms of temperature, pH and oxidation-reduction potential. The major finding of this part of the study is that a redox gradient as a function of temperature traverses the stability fields of the proteins in a way that largely parallels the proteins' spatial distribution. This redox gradient, expressed as activity of dissolved hydrogen, generally parallels estimates derived from measurements of sulfide/sulfate concentrations, oxidation-reduction potential electrodes, and dissolved oxygen, but is more reducing than any of those.\nThese results help to outline the interrelationships between biomolecular composition and geochemistry in the Bison Pool ecosystem. One use of these models is to quantify gradients in oxidation potential between the water and the interiors of cells and/or biofilms at the temperatures found in the hot spring. Another is to establish the extent to which organisms minimize the energy expenditure involved in formation of biomolecules in specific chemical environments. Generalizing the methods and calculations described below can aid in resolving the effects of chemical gradients, energy minimization and other features of this hot spring and other geobiochemical systems.\nMethods\nAverage oxidation state of carbon\nThe average nominal oxidation state of carbon, , is a quantity related to the different electronegativities of elements involved in the covalent structure of an organic molecule.  is equal to the sum of the nominal oxidation states of all the carbon atoms in a molecule divided by the number of carbon atoms. The concept of average oxidation state of carbon has found application in various contexts, ranging from balancing organic oxidation-reduction reactions [14] to characterization of organic matter in aerosols [15] and in terrestrial ecosystems [16]. Moreover, a correlation can be observed between the standard molal Gibbs energies of oxidation half-reactions and the average oxidation state of carbon of the organic molecules involved [17]. As with smaller molecules, it is possible to interpret the chemical composition of proteins using the average oxidation state of carbon.\nThe rules for calculating the formal oxidation states on any carbon atom can be summarized as follows [18]. Each single bond to a more electronegative element (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur) contributes  to the oxidation state of a particular carbon atom, while each single bond to a less electronegative element (e.g., hydrogen) contributes  to the oxidation state of a particular carbon atom, and a carbon-carbon bond counts (formally) as zero. Double bonds count doubly. Familiar, though extreme, examples are found with  (two double bonds to oxygen; ) and  (four single bonds to hydrogen; ). The concept of the average oxidation state can be extended to more complex molecules, for example acetic acid, , which has . That value is consistent with an oxidation state of  on the first carbon (having three bonds to hydrogen) and  on the second carbon (having one double bond and one single bond to oxygen).\nThe definition of oxidation state cited in the IUPAC Gold Book [19], [20] states that “… in ions the algebraic sum of the oxidation states of the constituent atoms must be equal to the charge on the ion” (i.e., positive or negative values for cations or anions, or zero for neutral species). We can adopt values for the formal charges of atoms other than carbon,  for oxygen,  for hydrogen,  for nitrogen,  for sulfur, that are consistent with this requirement for amino acids and proteins. The values for nitrogen and sulfur are those that would be assigned to the atoms if they were found in amine groups and sulfide groups, respectively [16]. Writing the formula of glycine as , the oxidation state of the first carbon is  (one bond to nitrogen, two bonds to hydrogen) and that of the second carbon is  (one double bond and one single bond to oxygen), so the average oxidation state of carbon in the molecule is . The sum of the formal charges of the atoms, in the order indicated by the formula, is , which is equal to the net charge of the molecule.\nIn many cases, the value of the average oxidation state of carbon is amenable to calculation using only the chemical formula of a molecule, instead of the more tedious accounting for each carbon. Let us use  to stand for the total charge on an ion (which becomes zero for a neutral molecule) and let the average oxidation state of carbon be represented by . Using formal oxidation states mentioned above for the elements other than carbon, the requirement for algebraic sums of oxidation states of the atoms can be expressed symbolically as(1)where , , ,  and  are the numbers of the respective subscripted elements in the chemical formula. Rearranging Eq. (1) gives(2)This equation shows that the average oxidation state of carbon in proteins is effectively a linear combination of the elemental ratios H/C, N/C, O/C and S/C.\nNote that ionization of the amino acid sidechains in proteins, and other ionization reactions involving only protons, have equal contributions to  and  and produce no net effect on the value of . Similarly, polymerization of amino acids, or other reactions involving only the gain or loss of a water molecule, produce no net effect on the value of  [18]. On the other hand, Eq. (2), and the electronegativity rules outlined above, show that oxidation-reduction reactions in organic compounds are not limited to gain or loss of either hydrogen or oxygen, but that the addition of other heteroatoms (sulfur, nitrogen) to a compound also causes an increase in the overall oxidation state of the molecule [18].\nThe average oxidation states of carbon in the twenty common amino acids range from  (leucine, isoleucine) to  (glycine, aspartic acid, asparagine) and are summarized in Table 1. The values listed for the amino acids in Table 1 span a considerable range but other types of organic molecules are even more or less oxidized [16], [17]. Proteins made up of these amino acids have an average oxidation state of carbon that can be computed as a weighted average of the  values of the amino acids, or equivalently, using Eq. (2) and the chemical formulas of the proteins. It may be noted that other physical-chemical properties of the amino acids can be correlated with differences in average oxidation state of carbon. For example, four highly hydrophobic amino acids (isoleucine, valine, leucine and phenylalanine) [21] have negative average oxidation states of carbon, which is associated with the high H/C ratios of their sidechain groups.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 1.  Average oxidation states of carbon and number of carbon atoms of the twenty amino acids commonly occurring in proteins.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0022782.t001\n\nRelative stabilities of proteins\nChemical thermodynamic methods, borrowed from geochemical modeling applications, can also be used to study the relative stabilities of model proteins from different sampling sites in the hot spring outflow channel. The methods are described conceptually below, followed by description of a specific example.\nFour informal definitions help introduce the modeling strategy. 1) Basis species are a minimum set of chemical constituents that represent all of the chemical elements and the ionization state of proteins. 2) A formation reaction is a chemical reaction to form one mole of a protein from the basis species. The formation reactions of different proteins have different coefficients on basis species because the proteins themselves have different chemical formulas. 3) Chemical affinity is energy change during a reaction; positive values mean energy is released, and negative values mean that energy is consumed. A reaction with a higher chemical affinity is more favored to proceed to the product side. 4) Chemical activity is related fundamentally to chemical potential and can be thought of as the effective concentration of a basis species or protein.\nLet us define one system of interest as a collection of proteins with equal chemical activities interacting with a physical-chemical environment defined by constant values of temperature, pressure, and chemical activities of the basis species. What is the relative stability of one protein compared to another? If the activities of the proteins are equal, the affinities of the formation reactions of the proteins are generally unequal to each other, and the system is not in equilibrium. The most stable protein is identified as the one with the highest chemical affinity of its formation reaction. That is the protein whose formation, at a given chemical activity, releases the most energy, or requires the least energy input.\nNow consider the outcome of hypothetical chemical reactions among the proteins, so that different proteins (chemical species) are formed and destroyed at each others' expense, and as a consequence the chemical activities of the proteins change. The temperature and pressure are maintained, and the system is open so that the activities of the basis species are buffered and therefore remain unchanged. One or more specific outcomes of the hypothetical progression of reactions is an assemblage of proteins in a (possibly metastable) equilibrium distribution. In this equilibrium, or minimum-energy state, the chemical affinities of the formation reactions of the proteins are all equal (but might be non-zero), so the hypothetical transformation of one protein to another involves no overall energy change. If the affinities of the formation reactions of the proteins are all equal but less than zero, then the proteins are less stable than the basis species; that system represents a type of metastable equilibrium and a local, not global, energy minimum. Since the system is at equilibrium, the most stable protein is identified as the one with the highest chemical activity – in terms of concentration it has a higher degree of formation compared to the other proteins.\nThe hypothetical systems described above consist of populations of proteins with either equal activities or equal affinities of formation. To a first approximation (under conditions of ideal mixing) the stabilities of the proteins relative to each other are the same in both cases, since the definition of the chemical environment – temperature, pressure and activities of the basis species – is unchanged. Therefore, it is helpful to conceptualize the systems with equal activities of proteins and equal affinities of protein-formation reactions as being different states of a more generic system, defined only by the chemical environment and the identities of the proteins, but not their chemical activities. The relationship between the equal-activity and equal-affinity reference states is shown schematically in Fig. 1. The relative stabilities of species A, B, and C are the same in both panels of the Figure. If an equal-activity reference state is adopted, greater stability goes with higher affinity (Fig. 1a). If the equal-affinity reference state is adopted, greater stability goes with higher activity (Fig. 1b).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.  Relative stabilities portrayed in different reference states.In these qualitative diagrams, the same relative stabilities are shown in two different reference states. Species “C” is more stable than “B” is more stable than “A”. Chemical activity is shown on the -axis, and chemical affinity of formation reaction is shown on the -axis. In the equal-activity, or non-equilibrium, reference state (left), the species with the most positive chemical affinity of formation is the most stable. In the equal-affinity, or metastable equilibrium, reference state (right), the species with the most positive chemical activity is the most stable.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0022782.g001In quantifying the relative stabilities of proteins, a choice can be made between the two reference states; either one is valid, but the relative stabilities of the proteins are revealed through different variables. To generate the figures in this paper relative stabilities were quantified using an equal-affinity, or metastable equilibrium reference state. The primary advantage of doing so is the production of equilibrium activity diagrams [22] that are interpreted as depicting the relative stabilities of the proteins in terms of temperature and activities of the basis species. The specific methods used to calculate relative stabilities of proteins starting with an equal-activity reference state, then using a reaction matrix or equilibrium distribution equation to quantify the activities of the proteins at metastable equilibrium are described below.\nThermodynamic definitions.An equation for the differential of Gibbs energy () that takes account of reaction progress in a system, formulated by de Donder [23], [24] can be written as(3)where , ,  and  are entropy, temperature, volume and pressure,  is chemical affinity, and  is a reaction progress variable. The chemical affinity of the th reaction can be expressed as(4)where  is the gas constant,  represents the natural logarithm of , and  and  are the equilibrium constant and activity product of the th reaction. The chemical affinity is equal to the negative of the overall Gibbs energy change of the reaction ().  and  can be calculated from(5)where  is the standard Gibbs energy of the th reaction, and(6)where  and  are the reaction coefficient (negative for reactants, positive for products) and activity of the th species in the th reaction. In the equations, all operations involving logarithms have a base of 10.\nThe standard state convention adopted for liquids, including , corresponds to unit activity of the pure substance at any temperature and pressure. The standard state convention adopted for aqueous species other than  corresponds to unit activity of a hypothetical one molal solution referenced to infinite dilution at any temperature and pressure [25]. The conventional standard molal thermodynamic properties of both the aqueous electron and proton are taken to be zero at all temperatures and pressures [26].\n\n\n\nCalculating relative stabilities of proteins\nThe case study described below is based on an example described previously [27] for calculating the equilibrium activities of cell-surface glycoproteins (CSG) from Methanococcus voltae and Methanocaldococcus jannaschii. These methanogenic organisms are not likely to be present in detectable quantities at Bison Pool in Yellowstone National Park, but they nevertheless are common model organisms for studying microbial adaptations to differences in temperature and other environmental characteristics [28], [29]. Clues about the organisms' environments may emerge from comparing the sequence and chemical properties of the two functionally homologous proteins.\nThe methods described here for calculating the amino acid and chemical composition as well as the standard molal properties of the proteins [11] are currently restricted to only the unfolded peptide molecules and not the carbohydrate constituent of the glycoproteins. In their uncharged states, the peptide chains of these two molecules have formulas of  and , respectively, with sequence lengths of 553 and 530 amino acid residues (UniProtKB accessions Q50833 for CSG_METVO and Q58232 for CSG_METJA; signal peptides were removed). At 25°C and , the charges of the ionized proteins calculated using standard Gibbs energies of ionization of the amino acid sidechains and protein terminal groups [11] are  and . Although the calculation of protein charge, which is based on group additivity, does not take into consideration the effects of interactions between the ionizable groups, it does have the advantage of being sensitive to changes in temperature.\nWriting formation reactions for residue equivalents.In general, the relative stabilities of proteins of different lengths are of interest. Because of the differences in size, the molal reaction energies can not be directly compared in calculations of relative stability. In many environments, the synthesis of larger molecules, per mole, demands more energy, so for proteins of otherwise equal chemical composition and thermodynamic properties (such as two proteins of different size but with the same relative frequencies of amino acids), the smaller one would generally be thought of as more stable. In more reduced settings, the overall synthesis of organic molecules can actually release energy [30], so the synthesis of larger molecules would be favored. Taking the polymeric nature of the proteins into account, the relative stabilities of proteins of different size can be assessed by first writing formation reactions that are normalized by numbers of amino acid residues. The reactions involve the residue equivalents of the proteins, which have chemical formulas and standard molal properties that are those of the protein divided by the sequence length of the protein. The following two formation reactions are written for the residue equivalents of the two protein homologs:(7)for the protein from M. voltae and(8)for that from M. jannaschii.\nThe reactions above involve the basis species , , , ,  and , which are the same as used in Ref. [27] except that  is used here instead of . The choice of basis species determines the expression for chemical activities, i.e. the way in which the environmental chemical potentials are quantified. Similarly to components, the set of basis species is valid only if they represent a number of independent variables equal to the dimension of chemical variability in the system. There are unlimited combinations of basis species that would qualify, but the actual choice is usually made to facilitate comparisons with the natural system. For the calculations described in this paper  is used instead of  because of the actual formation and metabolic significance of molecular hydrogen in the hot-spring ecosystem [31].\nWriting the formation reactions normalized per residue offers insight into the consequences of changing environmental variables on the relative stabilities of the proteins. Because Reactions 7 and 8 are written per residue of the proteins, comparing the reaction coefficients to infer the effect of changing chemical variables on the relative stabilities of the proteins is consistent with an overall reaction between the proteins that is balanced on the protein backbone group. For example, more moles of  are consumed in Reaction (8) compared to Reaction (7). From specific statements of Eqs. (4) and (6) for both reactions it follows that increasing the activity of  would tend to favor formation of – that is, decrease the energy change of the reaction for – the homolog from M. jannaschii more strongly than that from M. voltae. The effect of changing activity of hydrogen on the relative stabilities of proteins from M. jannaschii and M. voltae parallels differences in oxidation state of the natural environments of these two organisms. A likely range of activities of dissolved hydrogen in the mixing zones of submarine hydrothermal vents and ocean water, representative of the environments inhabited by M. jannaschii, is  to  at °C [30]. In lower-temperature estuarine sediments, typical of the growth setting of M. voltae, lower hydrogen concentrations of  to  have been observed [32].\nInspection of Reactions 7 and 8 implies that increasing activity of  tends to favor formation of the protein from M. jannaschii more strongly than that from M. voltae. This finding is the opposite of what is implied by the difference between the average oxidation state of carbon in CSG_METJA () and CSG_METVO (); the protein from M. jannaschii actually has a higher average oxidation state of carbon. While the average oxidation state of carbon can be derived solely from the chemical composition of the protein, the formation reactions set the stage for understanding relative stabilities of the proteins in terms of reaction stoichiometry, energy, and their relationships to multiple chemical variables represented by the basis species.\n\nCalculation of equilibrium constants.The equilibrium constants of each of the reactions can be calculated using the standard Gibbs energies of formation from the elements of the species in the reactions. In this study, the standard molal thermodynamic properties of aqueous species as a function of temperature and pressure were evaluated using the revised Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers (HKF) equations of state [25], [33], [34], [35]. The equations of state used for liquid  were taken from Refs. [36], [37], [38] as implemented in a Fortran subroutine in the SUPCRT92 software package [39]. Values of the standard molal thermodynamic properties and of the equations of state parameters for the basis species other than  and  were taken from Refs. [40], [34], [41].\nThe standard molal thermodynamic properties and equations of state parameters of the proteins can be calculated from amino acid group additivity [11]. In the present study, the CHNOSZ package [27] for the R software environment [42], which includes the group additivity equations for the proteins and the equations of state for calculating standard molal thermodynamic properties as a function of temperature, was used for the calculations. Sample code for performing the calculations for this example is included in Supporting Dataset S1. Combining the sources of data outlined above, values of  and  at 25°C and 1 bar can be obtained for these two reactions.\n\nCalculation of chemical affinities.The next step is to calculate the chemical affinities of the formation reactions in an equal-activity reference state. Let us use Eq. (4) to write(9)and(10)\nThe activities of the basis species are set to reference values nominally representative of environmental conditions. The activities of the basis species used in this example are taken from Ref. [27]: , , , ,  () and . The value for  was chosen so that the results would be numerically equivalent to those described in Ref. [27], where  was specified instead. Substituting these values into Eqs. (9) and (10) allows us to write(11)and(12)\nThe activities of the residue equivalents are related to the activities of the proteins as follows. Activity of the th protein () is related to concentration (, for molality) by(13)where  stands for the activity coefficient of the th protein. The total activity of residues in the th protein () is given by(14)where  stands for an activity coefficient. The total molality of residues associated with the th protein is(15)where  stands for the number of amino acid residues, or sequence length of the th protein.\nBecause of the high concentration of metabolites and biomacromolecules in cells, the activity coefficients of proteins in their natural subcellular environments are probably significantly different from unity [43], but available methods for calculating non-ideal behavior of protein solutions are referenced to electrolyte solutions [44] and depend on structural parameters of proteins that would be difficult to deduce from metagenomic sequence fragments. Under these circumstances the activity coefficients of both residues and proteins can be approximated as unity, and Eqs. (13)–(15) can be combined to write(16)To characterize the affinities in an equal-activity reference state, activities of the proteins nominally given by  are used for this example. Using Eq. (16), one then obtains reference activities of the residues given by  and  at 25°C and 1 bar.\nThe reference activities of the residues (computed from equal activities of proteins) can be substituted into Eqs. (11) and (12) to write  and . Therefore, on a per-residue basis, the homolog from M. jannaschii is more stable under the conditions (temperature, pressure, chemical activities of basis species) stated above. Decreasing the activity of hydrogen below a certain value, or changing the values of one or more variables in a specific manner determined by the reaction stoichiometry and Gibbs energy, would change the outcome so the homolog from M. voltae would be the more stable protein.\n\nCalculation of the metastable equilibrium activities of proteins: Reaction-matrix approach.Casting the relative stabilities of the proteins into a metastable equilibrium reference state facilitates comparisons on equilibrium activity diagrams. One approach involves a reaction matrix, where a system of equations is constructed based on the formation reactions of the proteins. In metastable equilibrium, the affinities of the formation reactions are all equal. Let us denote this value by . Combining  with Eqs. (11) and (12) permits writing(17)and(18)So far this is a system of two equations with three unknowns. A third equation arises from the conservation of activity of residues in the system; recall that activities are additive only if the activity coefficients are unity. Assigning both proteins reference activities of , the total activity of residues follows from Eq. (16):(19)The solution to the system of equations (17)–(19) is ,  and . It follows that the metastable equilibrium activities of the proteins (not the residues) are  and . As with the outcome of the equal-activity calculations described previously, CSG_METJA is found to be the more stable protein at the conditions of this example. Changes in temperature, pressure or activities of the basis species would alter these results; in some conditions, for example at more oxidizing conditions specified by lowering the activity of hydrogen, CSG_METVO would instead be the more stable protein.\nEach additional protein that is added to the system represents another unknown and another equation like Eq. (17) or (18), so this method is applicable to systems with any number of proteins. Note however that Eqs. (17)–(19), or others that would be written for different systems of proteins, do not constitute a linear system of equations; the unknown activities are summed in the last equation, but the logarithms of activities appear in the former equations. In software, a root finder can be used to solve these equations, leading to slow performance when the relative stabilities of many proteins (hundreds or thousands) are being considered. This performance penalty would not hinder the calculations described in this paper because at most five model proteins for each of the sampling sites are being considered. However, it is useful to consider a different approach, described in the next section, that is computationally more direct and yields identical results.\n\nCalculation of the metastable equilibrium activities of proteins: Boltzmann distribution.Let us define, for the per-residue formation reaction of the th protein,(20)It can be seen by comparison with Eqs. (4) and (6) that  includes all contributions to the chemical affinity of the th reaction except for the term associated with the activity of the residue equivalent of the protein of interest. For the per-residue formation reaction of the th protein, it follows that(21)where(22)where  enumerates all of the basis species, but not the protein, in the th reaction.\nIn physical applications, the Boltzmann distribution gives the probabilities of occupation of specific energy levels for systems in thermal equilibrium [45]; analogously for chemical systems it can be used to derive the equilibrium distributions of species [46]. An expression for the Boltzmann distribution, written using the current notation, is(23)Since the chemical affinity is the negative of the Gibbs energy of reaction, the exponents in Eq. (23) do not carry negative signs, unlike the energy terms in most common representations of the equation [45].\nFollowing the case study above, it can be deduced from Eqs. (11), (12) and (20) that , and . From Eq. (19) it follows that . Substituting these values into Eq. (23), one can directly calculate  and . These are the same as the values calculated above using the reaction-matrix approach, and can be combined with Eq. (16) to calculate the metastable equilibrium activities of the proteins. Application of Eq. (23) works as well for systems of three or more proteins and, compared to the reaction-matrix approach, leads to a more efficient implementation in software and faster calculations.\n\nEquilibrium activity diagrams.In the example described above, the calculations were carried out at only a single point in temperature-pressure-chemical activity space. The stability calculations can also be performed when one considers the effects of changing temperature, pressure, and/or chemical activities of the basis species, singly or in combination. Interpreting the results of this type of calculation is facilitated by visualizing the relative stabilities of the proteins on equilibrium activity diagrams. In the Results described below, the lines on chemical speciation diagrams show the metastable equilibrium activities of the proteins as a function of a single or composite variable on the -axis. Where two variables are being considered, the fields on predominance diagrams show the protein with the highest metastable equilibrium activity, as a function of the two variables on the - and -axes.\nThe thermodynamic calculations and stability diagrams reported below were made using the CHNOSZ software package [27]. The package encodes the equations of state, thermodynamic data, and the group additivity algorithms for proteins cited above. In recent versions of the software, the Boltzmann distribution was implemented for calculating the relative stabilities of proteins, and the calculations reported below use this method. The source code for the calculations reported in this paper, written in the R language [42] and utilizing the functions available in CHNOSZ, is available in the Supporting Information of this paper; Dataset S1 contains code for the example described above, and Dataset S2 contains the code used to produce the figures in the Results.\n\n\n\nContribution by energy of protein folding to uncertainty in chemical stability calculations\nThe group additivity algorithm adopted here for calculating the standard molal Gibbs energies of proteins is referenced to unfolded aqueous proteins [11]. Most proteins in their active forms adopt a folded conformation. The energy change for the folding reaction, or change of conformation, is commonly referred to as “protein stability” [47]. The latter nevertheless is distinct from the chemical stabilities being considered in this study, which are based on energies of protein formation. However, the energy change in the folding process contributes some uncertainty, assessed below, to the values adopted here for the standard Gibbs energies of the proteins.\nIt was estimated that the uncertainty in standard Gibbs energies of proteins inherent in the group additivity algorithm is of the order of five percent [11]. The values of  of the non-ionized forms CSG_METVO and CSG_METJA calculated using group additivity are  and  kJ mol ( and  kcal mol), respectively [27]; a nominal 5% uncertainty corresponds to  and  kJ mol ( and  kcal mol). For proteins of comparable size, Gibbs energies of folding of 40–80 kJ mol (10–20 kcal mol) are not uncommon, depending on the temperature [48], [47]. These values are approximately one-one hundredth the magnitude of the estimated uncertainties in the additive standard Gibbs energies of the unfolded proteins. Moreover, the effect of any systematic uncertainty that affects the standard Gibbs energies of the proteins in the same direction (as would the folding process) would tend to cancel in the relative stability calculations. Therefore, not accounting for the energy of protein folding contributes little to the overall uncertainty of the relative stability calculations.\n\nResults\nDescription of field site and metagenomic sampling\nChemical and biological sampling was performed in July 2005 at the hot spring known as “Bison Pool” in the Sentinel Meadows in the Lower Geyser Basin of Yellowstone National Park [12]. “Bison Pool” is the unofficial name of a hot spring whose source pool is located at approximately 44.56961°N, 110.86513°W (WGS 84 datum), the closest officially named feature being called Rosette Geyser [49]. A map identifying the sampling sites referred to in this study, based on one found in Ref. [12], is shown in Fig. 2. The spring emits a continuous flow of boiling (°C), moderately alkaline (pH7.5) water, and emerges from within a base of sinter made of silica that has precipitated from the water. The winding outflow channel is occupied by a plethora of biofilms in a striking array of colors. At this and similar springs, the white and pink filaments found at higher temperatures harbor chemotrophic organisms such as Aquificae and some Archaea [50], [49]. Yellow, orange and green biofilms (thick mats) found at lower temperatures are predominantly made up of photosynthetic communities of Cyanobacteria and relatives of Chloroflexi [51], [13], although archaeal organisms can also be found at the lower temperatures [13].\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 2.

Site 3 is notable because it is within the “photosynthetic fringe”, or the transition zone (ecotone) where bright colors indicate the onset of photosynthetic potential [52], [12]. A summary of some of the field- and laboratory-based chemical analyses of the water relevant to this study is given in Table 2. Together with a decrease in temperature down the outflow channel, there is an increase in pH. An increase in the oxidation potential of the water is also apparent from the higher dissolved oxygen and lower sulfide concentrations observed in water sampled away from the source.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 2.  Sampling site identification, distance from source pool, and summary of chemical and molecular sequence data at five sampling sites at Bison Poola.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0022782.t002The biofilm samples used for metagenomic sequencing were collected at the same time as the water samples used for chemical analysis [12], except for field measurements of oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), which were obtained in 2009. Environmental DNA in the biofilm samples was shotgun-sequenced by the Joint Genome Institute using the Sanger method. The assembly and annotation of protein coding sequences was carried out through an automated pipeline in the Integrated Microbial Genomes with Microbiome Samples (IMG/M) system [53], and sequences used in this study were downloaded from the IMG/M website (http://img.jgi.doe.gov/m).\n\n\nAmino acid compositions of model proteins\nFor this study, FASTA data files containing predicted protein sequences were downloaded from IMG/M using the taxonomic IDs BISONN, BISONS, etc. The letter codes for all the sampling sites are listed in Table 2, together with the total numbers of metagenomic reads and protein-coding sequences for each site.\nBecause they are derived from shotgun sequencing, most of the inferred protein-coding sequences are actually fragments of whole genes. It would be possible to select specific types of homologs, align the sequence fragments, and use the aligned positions in the stoichiometric and thermodynamic calculations described below. However, the calculation of the average oxidation states of carbon requires only the chemical formula of the proteins, and the calculation of the standard Gibbs energies of the proteins as described in the Methods only requires the amino acid compositions of the proteins. Therefore, in this study, model amino acid compositions were used to represent averages of groups of protein sequences in the metagenome.\nThe five “overall model proteins” have average amino acid compositions that were calculated as the average of all inferred protein sequences, including fragments, identified in the metagenome at each site. The amino acid compositions of the overall model proteins were calculated by summing the amino acid counts of all sequences at each site and dividing by the total number of sequences at each site. Accordingly, the model proteins are not whole proteins, but instead have fractional amino acid frequencies. The amino acid compositions are listed in Supporting Dataset S3.\nThe average amino acid compositions were also calculated for “classified model proteins” in twenty functional classes each corresponding to a keyword in the sequence annotations reported in IMG/M. The keywords were selected based on their frequencies in the annotations and represent a variety of functions and cellular structures, but are neither comprehensive nor mutually exclusive. The keywords and number of identified sequences are listed in Table 3. The classification with the highest number of inferred protein sequences is “transferase”, with a total of 15768 sequences across all five sampling sites, or ca. 5.4% of all of the protein sequences in the metagenome. The classification with the fewest number of sequences is “phosphatase”, with a total of 2260 sequences, or about 0.8% of the metagenome. All the keyword searches were case-insensitive and any match was accepted (e.g., an annotation including the word “transporter” was matched by the “transport” keyword), except for “reductase”, which was only matched to the beginning of a word in the annotation (e.g., annotations including the word “oxidoreductase” were not matched by the “reductase” keyword).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 3.

The 95% confidence intervals around the mean values were calculated from a bootstrap analysis (nonparametric, ordinary bootstrap, 1000 replicates) performed using the “boot” package for the R software environment [42]. The results are plotted in Fig. 3 and the numerical values given in Supporting Dataset S4.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 3.  Elemental ratios and average oxidation state of carbon in protein sequences.Elemental ratios were calculated from the chemical formulas of all protein sequences available in the Bison Pool environmental genome, and average oxidation state of carbon () was calculated using Eq. (2). The bars are centered on the means, and the heights of the bars represent the 95% confidence intervals derived from a bootstrap analysis.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0022782.g003The S/C, O/C and N/C ratios shown in Fig. 3 exhibit an overall increase with distance from the hot-spring source, but there is a decrease in S/C and O/C of the proteins from site 3. The H/C ratio rises sharply between sites 1 and 2 and then decreases, with the proteins at site 3 again having a relatively lower value. The combined effect of the elemental ratios accounts for the trend in  appearing in Fig. 3, which can be described as increasing with distance from the hot-spring source. The chemical compositions of the proteins at sites 4 and 5 are more similar to each other than to the other sites, and the overall trends for elemental ratios and  show a slight reversal at these two sites.\nThe average oxidation state of carbon of overall and classified model proteins is shown in Fig. 4a. Because of the number of lines plotted in this figure only selected ones are labeled. The others can be identified by referring to the values of  for the model proteins for site 1 listed in Table 3. Whatever the classification of the model protein, there in an increase in  going from site 1 to site 5, and in most cases an increase between each of sites 1 through 4. Generally, there is a slight decrease in the value of  between sites 4 and 5. The differences between the different classes of model proteins are profound: the oxidoreductases, transport and membrane proteins, and especially permeases, all have lower oxidation states of carbon than the others. This result is not surprising, given the greater abundance of hydrophobic sidechains in these predominantly membrane-associated [54] proteins. The model proteins that have the highest oxidation states of carbon are hydrolase at sites 1–3 and transposase at sites 4 and 5. That the transposase model proteins at sites 4 and 5 are more oxidized than other model proteins is noteworthy because at site 1 the transposase model protein has a value of  that is only a little greater than that of the overall model protein.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 4.

(2) for the overall model proteins for each sampling site are shown by the bold green line, and those for each of the 20 classes of model proteins listed in Table 3 are shown by the thin lines. For clarity, only selected classes are labeled; hydrolase and protease are the ones with highest and lowest values of  among the main group of lines at the top.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0022782.g004Some relationships can be observed between the chemical composition of proteins and the chemical characteristics of the water. On the whole, there is a positive correlation between the values of  of the model proteins and the field measurements of dissolved oxygen, and a negative correlation with total sulfide concentrations listed in Table 2. The correlations suggest that analysis of the energetics of the protein formation reactions could be used to combine protein composition and hot-spring chemistry in a thermodynamic model. In the following sections results are presented from a thermodynamic analysis that describes the relative stabilities of proteins in terms of temperature, pH, oxidation potential and other environmental variables.\n\n\nRelative stabilities of model proteins: Metastable equilibrium\nResidue-normalized formation reactions for the overall model proteins are listed in Table 4. These reactions are written in terms of the basis species , , , ,  and , which correspond to inorganic sources of the major elements in the proteins. Because the number of amino acid residues in each of the model proteins is the average of the lengths of metagenomically derived protein sequences, including many fragments, the number of amino acids in each of the model proteins in Table 4 does not necessarily reflect the actual lengths of protein sequences in the microbial organisms in the hot spring.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 4.  Numbers of amino acid residues, average oxidation state of carbon, and per-residue formation reactions normalized per residue for overall model proteins for different sampling sites.adoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0022782.t004Because the reactions in Table 4 are written for the formation of the residue equivalents of the model proteins, the reactions are effectively balanced with respect to the protein backbone group. Consequently, the stoichiometric reaction coefficients are independent of the sizes of the model proteins and can be compared with each other in a first approximation to assess the effects of changing chemical conditions on the relative stabilities of the model proteins. For example, the coefficients on , appearing on the reactant side of the reactions, decrease in order of increasing distance from the hot spring source, except for the last two sites, where the pattern is reversed. Therefore, increasing the chemical activity of  tends to decrease the energy demand of forming overall model proteins at the high-temperature sites more strongly than the others.\nThe intensive variables used in the equilibrium calculations are temperature (), pressure (), and the chemical activities of the basis species and proteins. Activity coefficients of all species can be set to unity, so, for aqueous species, chemical activities were taken to be equivalent to concentrations in molal units. As noted above, the activity coefficients of proteins in subcellular conditions are currently not amenable to general calculation. In addition, the concentrations of major ions in the water [55] are low enough that setting the activity coefficients of the basis species to unity is a tolerable first approximation. In the calculations reported below, the variables held constant were  bar, , , , . The activities chosen for  and  are based on the measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon and sulfide listed in Table 2, while that of  is a nominal value. The calculations of metastable equilibrium were referenced to unit total activity of the amino acid residues in the system. The other variables (, pH and ) were used as exploratory variables as described below.\nThe results of computations of relative stabilities of the overall model proteins are depicted in Fig. 5. Values of temperature measured at each site in the hot spring (Table 2) are shown in Fig. 5a. Stability calculations were performed for a system composed of the five overall model proteins, using the pH measured at site 3. The most stable overall model proteins as a function of temperature and  are shown in the equilibrium predominance diagram in Fig. 5b. The temperature range in this diagram is somewhat larger than the measured range of temperature in the hot spring, and the range of  was set to encompass the stability fields of the proteins.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 5.

Panel (f) is a plot of the relative stabilities of the overall proteins as a function of the combination of changes with distance of measured temperature and pH and modeled  (using Eq. 24).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0022782.g005Values of pH measured at each site are shown in Fig. 5c. Stability calculations using the temperature measured at site 3 lead to the equilibrium predominance diagram shown in Fig. 5d. The pH range in this diagram is slightly larger than the measured range of pH in the hot spring.\nNote that in Figs. 5b and d, only the overall model proteins from sites 1, 2 and 4 appear, going from high to low values of  in that order. Increasing pH at constant  and temperature (Fig. 5d) moves toward the relative stability fields for the overall model proteins that are more distal from the hot-spring source; this pattern is congruent with the pH differences between sampling sites in the hot spring. On the other hand, decreasing temperature at constant  and pH (Fig. 5b) moves toward the relative stability fields for the overall model proteins that are more proximal to the hot-spring source; this pattern is incongruent with the temperature gradient in the outflow channel of the hot spring.\nIf it were representative of the chemical gradients in the hot spring, the thermodynamic model used here would generate a pattern of relative stabilities of the model proteins that reflects their geographical distribution. It is apparent from the above findings that this is not possible if  is constant along the outflow channel. Instead, the dashed lines in Figs. 5b and d and the equilibrium chemical activities of the proteins shown in Figs. 5e and f are consistent with changing  in the model together with the measured changes in temperature and pH and , and were derived by considering the relative stabilities of many classes of model proteins as described below.\n\n\nOperational equation for activity of hydrogen\nFigure 6 contains -temperature equilibrium predominance diagrams for the 20 classes of model proteins listed in Table 3. These figures were constructed in a manner analogous to Fig. 5b. For each class of model proteins shown in Fig. 6 the protein from site 1 is relatively stable at higher values of , and the protein from site 4 or 5 occupies the low- portion of the diagram. Other details differ between the various classes of model proteins; for example, the model protein for phosphatase at site 1 is stable relative to the model proteins for phosphatase at other sites only at highly reduced conditions. Compared to other classes of proteins, the predominance field for the model protein for oxidoreductase at site 2 is much smaller, and that for the ribosomal proteins at site 2 does not even appear. In spite of these differences, the overall resemblance of the plots in Fig. 6 to each other and to Fig. 5b indicates that different subsets of the metagenome have similar relative stability relationships.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 6.  Equilibrium predominance diagrams for classified model proteins.For each class of model proteins, the fields in these predominance diagram represent the model protein with the most positive equilibrium activity as a function of  and temperature. pH was set to the value listed in Table 2 for site 3 and the chemical activities of the other basis species were set to reference values specified in the Results section. The dashed line in each diagram indicates values of  calculated using Eq. (24).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0022782.g006The dashed lines in Fig. 5b and d and Fig. 6 denote values of  that are given by the function(24)This equation is the result of a graphical regression of the plots in Fig. 5b and Fig. 6 such that the values of  as a function of temperature give a progression in the stability fields of a majority of the model proteins that is similar to the geographical distribution of the proteins. For example, in Fig. 5b, the line given by Eq. (24) encounters the stability fields for the overall model proteins for sites 1, 2 and 4, in that order, with decreasing temperature.\nNote that the plot in Fig. 5d is drawn for a single temperature (that for site 3 listed in Table 2), so the line for  is horizontal in this figure. The line crosses the predominance field boundary between sites 2 and 4 at pH , which is close to the measured pH of site 3 (Table 2). The absence of a predominance field for the model protein for site 3 in this figure and in most plots shown in Fig. 6 suggests that generally the proteins at site 3 are less stable than the model proteins for other sites, even under the specific conditions of site 3.\n\n\nEffects of other variables\nThe model developed here incorporates spatial gradients of pH and activity of hydrogen, but in principle other chemical variables could also contribute significantly to the relative stabilities of the proteins. For example, the concentration of dissolved sulfide decreases by more than an order of magnitude between the source of the hot spring and the most distal sampling site (Table 2). However, the consequences of that gradient on the relative stabilities of any two proteins is proportional to the difference in the reaction coefficient of sulfide between the two reactions. In Table 4, the largest difference between reaction coefficients on  is only , which is much smaller than the differences in the relative stabilities of the proteins ( for any of the sites listed the Table). Accordingly, the sulfide concentration in the model was set to a constant since the changes seen in the hot spring have a smaller effect on the relative stabilities of the proteins compared to temperature, pH and . For comparison, the difference between reaction coefficients on  in the formation reactions of overall model proteins 1 and 2 is , while the difference in relative stabilities of the proteins is , so a one-order-of-magnitude decrease in the activity of , by itself, is enough to increase the relative stability of the model protein for site 2 over site 1.\nConversely, although the coefficients on  in the reactions shown in Table 4 differ from each other more than those on , the measured concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon differ by not more than 4 ppm between the sites (Table 2). Therefore, the small changes in the corresponding activities of  would not be expected to significantly alter the chemical affinities of the reactions relative to each other, so, as with sulfide, the activity of  was set to a constant value.\nThe calculations described above used a nominal value of  for the activity of . Total ammonia was not detected above 0.01 mg/L (0.6 mol) in spectrophotometric analysis of water at the hot spring [55], so it is reasonable to ask whether lowering the activity  to  has a major effect on the calculations of relative stabilities. The interdependence of equilibrium activities of the basis species can be assessed by writing a reaction representing the transformation between two proteins, for example the overall model proteins for sites 2 and 4. Adding reaction 4 in Table 4 to the opposite of reaction 2 yields the following reaction:(25)It follows from Eqs. (4)–(6) that, if the chemical affinity of Reaction 25 and the activities of all other reactants and products remain unchanged, decreasing  by 3 results in a decrease in the calculated  of  (i.e., ). Likewise, reconnaissance calculations indicate that decreasing the activity of  to  generally results in a lowering of the equal-activity lines shown in Fig. 6, with a more pronounced effect for the lower equal-activity lines, which in some cases shift downwards by at about half a  unit. Therefore, refinement of the calculations described here may yield results that support modifying Eq. (24) to have a somewhat steeper slope and lower intercept. Nevertheless, without any direct measurements of the total ammonia concentration, such refinements remain speculative.\n\n\nRelative stabilities of model proteins: Chemical affinities\nChemical affinities for the per-residue formation reactions of the overall model proteins in an equal-activity reference state calculated for sites 1 to 5 are listed in Table 5. The calculations used values of temperature and pH listed in Table 2,  for each of these sites taken from Eq. 24, and activities of the other basis species given above. The activities of the residue equivalents of each of the model proteins were set to unity. All of the reactions listed in Table 4 are endergonic reactions, which is apparent from the negative values of chemical affinity that are shown in Table 5. However, the chemical affinities are less negative at the higher-temperature, more reduced conditions, which is consistent with a previous comparison of the energetics of biomass synthesis under oxic and anoxic conditions [56].\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 5.  Chemical affinities for the reactions in Table 4 at the model conditions for each site.adoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0022782.t005Examination of Table 5 shows that the reaction with the greatest chemical affinity at site 1 is that for the overall model protein for that site. In contrast, at the conditions of sites 3–5 the formation, per residue, of the model protein for site 4 is the least energetically demanding. The affinities listed in Table 5 are calculated for the formation reactions of the proteins normalized per residue, but comparison of the relative stabilities of the proteins (as is done on the predominance diagrams) requires further accounting for the relative lengths of the model proteins. Equation (16) was used to account for different lengths when constructing equilibrium activity diagrams for proteins. Analogously, by subtracting the logarithm (base 10) of the number of amino acids present in each of the model proteins from the values listed in Table 4, one obtains length-corrected affinities per residue that can be compared with the equilibrium activity diagrams. For example, performing this operation on the second column of Table 5 shows that the model protein from site 2 is the most stable, even though the per-residue reaction for site 1 has a greater chemical affinity, before applying the length correction. The outcome is in accord with the progression, from sites 1 to 2 to 4, in the relative stabilities of the overall model proteins apparent in Figs. 5b and d.\n\n\nCombined analysis of temperature, pH and oxidation potential\nReturning to the metastable equilibrium (equal-affinity) reference state, the equilibrium activities of the proteins are plotted in Fig. 5e as functions of  at constant temperature and pH (corresponding to site 3) for a total activity of residues equal to one. Nowhere does the equilibrium chemical activity of the overall model protein for site 3 rise above all the others, which is consistent with Fig. 5b, but it is also apparent that the activity for this model protein maximizes at intermediate values of . The relative instability of the model proteins for site 3 throughout the different classes of model proteins is apparent from the low frequency of predominance fields representing this site appearing in Fig. 6. It can also be seen in Fig. 5e that the overall model proteins representing sites 4 and 5 are similar to each other in terms of their relative stabilities.\nTo portray the effects of changing temperature, pH and  simultaneously, all of these variables are projected along the -axis (“distance”) in Fig. 5f. The values of temperature and pH at any point along the distance axis are taken from the curves shown in Figs. 5a and c, and the values of  are calculated using Eq. (24). Fig. 5f has the advantage that the relative stabilities of the model proteins are shown as a function of a spatial variable and can therefore be compared with the physical location of the sampling sites in the hot spring.\nIn order to visualize the relative stabilities of all of the groups of model proteins on a single figure, the equilibrium activities () of the proteins were transformed into equilibrium degrees of formation. The degree of formation of the th model protein () is given by(26)where the summation occurs over all of the model proteins in the calculation, which in this case is five (one for each sampling site). Since , the degree of formation of any protein can be visualized as a fraction of a bar of unit length. The equilibrium degrees of formation of the overall and classified model proteins are shown as a function of distance in Fig. 7. In this figure, the color code refers to the five sampling sites, and the height of the bars represents the equilibrium degree of formation of the indicated model protein. At any point along the distance axis, the bars are stacked with the most relatively stable model protein on the top. The locations and color codes of the sampling sites are indicated by the tick marks.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 7.  Equilibrium degrees of formation of model proteins in 21 classes.The locations of the sampling sites are indicated by the colored tick marks. The degrees of formation of the five model proteins in each class are shown by the heights of the color-coded bars. At any point on the distance axis, the bars are stacked in order of relative stability, so that the most stable (highest equilibrium degree of formation) is at the top.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0022782.g007Fig. 7 permits a visual test of the overall goodness of fit of Eq. (24) to the geographical relationships of the sampling sites and also helps in identifying outliers. At the high-temperature end, the most stable model protein is usually that from site 1, and rarely from site 2 (phosphatase, periplasmic). At the low-temperature end, the most stable protein is usually that from site 4 or 5 (with approximately equal frequency) and only occasionally from sites 2 (transcription) or 3 (transposase). The only model proteins for site 3 that are the most relatively stable over any part of the combined chemical gradient are those for transposase (over the mid- to low-temperature range), oxidoreductase and phosphatase (only at moderate temperatures). The transition zone occurring toward the middle of the plots is sometimes associated with an increase in the relative stability of the model proteins for site 3 (e.g., transferase, synthase), but in many other cases the equilibrium degree of formation of the model proteins for site 3 minimizes relative to the other sites. The overall relative instability of the proteins from site 3 is can be attributed to constraints on their amino acid compositions that also account for the shifts in O/C, H/C, and S/C for these proteins from the overall trends between sites apparent in Fig. 3. A major exception is transposase, for which the model proteins from site 3 are relatively stable over much of the chemical gradient. As in the general case, the relative stabilities are conditioned by trends in amino acid composition that also affect elemental ratios, apparent in Fig. 4 as a high oxidation state of carbon of the transposase model proteins at sites 4 and 5.\n\n\nMeasurements of oxidation-reduction potential\nEq. (24) represents a proposal for the temperature dependence of the activity of hydrogen derived from the relative stabilities of the model proteins. It can be compared with a variety of other measurements that are indicators of redox conditions of the hydrothermal solution including results of field measurements of redox conditions made using an oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) probe.\nORP, temperature and pH readings obtained in Summer 2009 for Bison Pool (four years after the biofilm sampling for metagenomic analysis and acquisition of chemical data reported in Table 2) and other flowing hot springs in Yellowstone are listed in Table 6 and in Dataset S5. The ORP measurements were obtained at three sites at Bison Pool that approximated the original locations of sites 3, 4 and 5. ORP, pH and temperature measurements at higher temperatures were also obtained at Mound Spring, which is the official name a nearby hot spring in Sentinel Meadows with chemical features similar to Bison Pool [55].\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 6.  Meter readings for selected hot springs and their outflows in Yellowstone National Park, Summer 2009.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0022782.t006Temperature and pH were measured in the field with hand-held temperature/conductivity (YSI, Yellow Springs, Ohio) and pH meters (WTW, Weilheim, Germany 300i pH meter with SenTix 41 pH electrode). Oxidation-reduction potential was measured using a high-temperature ORP probe (PI-M11-ORP-HT) rated to greater than 80°C and a Thermo Scientific pH/mV meter with a readout sensitivity of 1 mV, both acquired from Pulse Instruments (Van Nuys, CA). The ORP probe contains a silver-silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) reference electrode with saturated KCl solution. Before the field work, the ORP meter was calibrated in the laboratory at 25°C using a stock of Light's Solution (ferrous/ferric sulfate in sulfuric acid) supplied by Pulse Instruments. The stated potential of the solution is  mV at 25°C vs. saturated KCl/AgCl electrode.\nTo convert the ORP readings (referenced to the Ag/AgCl electrode) to Eh (referenced to the standard hydrogen electrode, or SHE) we used(27)where E(Ag/AgCl) is the potential vs. SHE of the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The potential of the reference electrode was calculated using an equation for Ag/AgCl with 1M KCl electrolyte [57](28)where  is in volts and  is in degrees Celsius. The effect of differences between the saturated and 1M KCl Ag/AgCl electrodes is discussed further below.\nValues of Eh calculated by combining field measurements of ORP with Eqs. (27) and (28) are shown in Fig. 8a. The hot springs are identified by the number codes given in Table 6, and the source pools are indicated by bold symbols. The values for Mound Spring and Bison Pool (points labeled “3” and “4” in the figure) increase with decreasing temperature and are similar to an unnamed hot spring in Sentinel Meadows for which data are available (points labeled “5” in the figure; the GPS locations of this and other springs are given in Table 6).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 8.  Calculated Eh and activity of hydrogen in hot springs.Eh and equilibrium  as functions of temperature for various hot springs were calculated from measured values of pH and ORP listed in Table 6. The different hot springs are identified by numbers (see Table 6 for key), and bold symbols indicate the sources of the hot springs.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0022782.g008Equilibrium values of  were calculated by combining Eh, pH and temperature. The values of Eh were first converted to pe (the negative of the logarithm of the activity of the electron) using [26](29)where  denotes the Faraday constant. Then,  was calculated from the law of mass action for(30)that is,(31)Values of  calculated using the standard molal properties of the species in Reaction 30 (see Methods) were combined with pe and pH to generate the values of  shown in Fig. 8b. These values correspond to equilibrium with both protons (activities constrained by pH measurements) and electrons (activities inferred from the ORP measurements, which does not capture the full spectrum of reactivity of electrons in the solution).\nAt 25°C the potential of the Ag/AgCl electrode (1M KCl) calculated using Eq. (28) is  V. In contrast, the potential of the Ag/AgCl electrode with saturated KCl, which might be a more appropriate choice for calculations given the specifications of the ORP probe used for the measurements, is about 0.197V [58], or about 0.025V lower. Eqs. 29 and 31 can be used to calculate that a decrease of 0.025V at constant pH would increase the equilibrium  by approximately  at 25°C and  at 100°C. Changes of this magnitude would not drastically affect the relative positions of the points and lines shown in Fig. 8a or the comparisons drawn further below. The difference between the potentials of the 1M and saturated KCl electrode is probably also comparable in size to the total uncertainty in the measurement of oxidation-reduction potential in reactive hydrothermal fluids (see for example Ref. [59]). Therefore, the values of E(Ag/AgCl) used to calculate Eh from ORP (Eq. 27) were taken from Eq. (28) without modification.\nAlthough the water at Mound Spring had a higher pH than reported for Bison Pool (see Table 6) the equilibrium values of  calculated using Reaction 30 for the two hot springs are close to each other at similar temperatures. The values of  calculated in this manner for the outflow channels of Bison Pool and Mound Spring are lower than other hot springs at the same temperatures shown in Fig. 8b, but a more reduced fluid at higher temperatures seems to be the case for any of the measured hot springs.\n\n\nComparison of equilibrium activities of hydrogen\nConcentrations of chemical species such as dissolved oxygen, and species with an element in different oxidation states (e.g. sulfide and sulfate) can be expressed on the  redox scale using relationships derived from chemical equilibrium. Values of  for equilibrium between dissolved sulfide (as ) and sulfate () were obtained using the law of mass action for(32)at the temperature of each sampling site. The law of mass action is the relationship (Eq. 4) between the equilibrium constant () and activity product () of this reaction when the chemical affinity () of the reaction is zero (see Eq. 31 for an example). Activities of  and  were taken to be equal to molalities of the species listed in Table 2, and values of  were again obtained using standard molal thermodynamic properties of the species as a function of temperature calculated as described in the Methods.\nValues of  in equilibrium with dissolved oxygen were obtained using the law of mass action for(33)using activities of  derived from the concentrations listed in Table 2.\nFig. 9 shows a comparison of the activities of hydrogen calculated using Eq. (24) and activities of hydrogen in equilibrium with measured oxidation-reduction potentials (ORP) and the oxygen and sulfur redox indicators described above. The temperature dependence of the equilibrium  is strongest for the ORP measurements and weakest for the sulfur system. Among the three different redox indicators considered here (ORP, sulfide/sulfate, and dissolved oxygen) the lowest values of  come from equilibrium with dissolved oxygen and the highest for equilibrium in the sulfide/sulfate reaction. All of the redox indicators have lower equilibrium values of  than those calculated using Eq. (24).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 9.  Comparison of different estimates of hydrogen activity as a function of temperature.Values shown for sulfide/sulfate and dissolved oxygen were computed using measured concentrations of those species listed in Table 2. Values shown for “Eh” were computed using pHs and ORP readings listed in Table 6. The solid line indicates values calculated using Eq. (24).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0022782.g009These three proxies are limiting cases, indicating what the values of  would be if each of the reactions dictated the actual hydrogen activity in the system. Therefore, the separation of the lines in Fig. 9 provides evidence that overall redox equilibrium does not characterize the hot spring (see Ref. [55] for further evidence of redox disequilibria in hot springs). Nevertheless, the simplest explanation for the trends shown in Fig. 9 is that the states of various redox reactions in the water are all becoming more oxidized with decreasing temperature, and that the redox gradient derived from the relative stabilities of the proteins (Eq. 24) occurs at more reducing conditions than any of the inorganic oxidation-reduction reactions.\n\nBy computing the standard Gibbs energies of overall reactions representing the formation of proteins, and using geochemical data on the gradients of temperature and chemistry, the relative stabilities of model proteins derived from metagenomic sequences in a hot spring could be calculated. It was possible to compute relative stabilities of the model proteins that reflect their overall spatial distribution in the system. An equation for hydrogen activity as a function of temperature was proposed, as a way of calibrating the model to maximize the correspondence between the geographical distributions of the sampling sites and the progression of relative stabilities of proteins.There is a general increase in average oxidation state of carbon in the model proteins that parallels the rising redox potential of species in the water as it flows away, also cooling, from the hot spring. However, the average oxidation states of carbon in the different classes of model proteins are offset from each other, with membrane-associated proteins (including permeases, transport proteins and oxidoreductases) being more reduced. As noted above, hydrophobic amino acids tend to have lower oxidation states of carbon, so an increase in the number of hydrophobic amino acids can account for a decrease in average oxidation state of carbon in the proteins. An increased frequency of hydrophobic amino acids in proteins is a likely feature of adaptation to higher temperatures, as seen in the genomes of model organisms [60], [61]. Our metagenomically based finding of a negative correlation between temperature and oxidation state of carbon is consistent with those results.The oxidation states of carbon in the different classes of model proteins increase along the outflow channel of the hot spring, except for a slight decrease between sites 4 and 5. The apparent inversion in relative stabilities between sites 4 and 5 might be connected to additional hydrogen input, possibly from oxygenic photosynthesizers [62], as a byproduct of nitrogen fixation [63] or fermentation, and/or from secondary sources of reduced gases in the hot-spring system.A distinctive feature of the chemical compositions of the proteins in the study area is the departure of site 3 from the general trends for H/C, O/C and S/C shown in Fig. 3, the infrequent appearance of the model proteins for site 3 in the diagrams in Fig. 6, and the generally low equilibrium degrees of formation of these proteins in Fig. 7. Therefore, the model proteins for site 3 are on average less stable, or have a greater energy of formation, than those from other sites. This result could imply that there are specific metabolic requirements of the organisms at site 3, near the photosynthetic fringe, that cause them to produce proteins that are relatively energetically demanding.The calculations described here may help elucidate the redox gradients between and cellular interiors and their surroundings. The interiors of bacterial cells such as Escherichia coli are more reduced than the growth medium in laboratory experiments [64], but much remains unknown about the redox conditions of microbial interiors in high-temperature environments. Fig. 9 shows that effective values of  in equilibrium with sulfur/sulfide, dissolved oxygen, and inferred Eh values, all measured on bulk water samples in the field, decrease as as a function of temperature (oxygen and Eh more so), but that the protein-equilibrium-based model equation for  is more reduced than any of these proxies. This finding implies that the interiors of the microbial cells, where the proteins are mainly present, are more reduced than the environmental conditions at the temperatures in the hot spring. There is, however, not a general agreement about the redox conditions inside microbial cells; relatively oxidized conditions would help to account for the probable frequent occurrence of disulfide bonds in proteins in archaeal organisms (including some hyperthermophilic representatives) [65]. It would be useful to have data on subcellular redox indicators (e.g. oxidized and reduced forms of glutathione) at high temperatures to help resolve these questions.Outlining the convergence of physical, chemical and biological forces that shape the information present in metagenomic sequences would benefit from the development of more sophisticated thermodynamic models and a tighter connection with phylogenetic approaches. For example, the construction of the model proteins could be based on identification of housekeeping genes that are conserved across phyla [66]. The use of only aligned sequences therein would help to eliminate some of the noise inherent in averaging shotgun sequence fragments, leading to a closer resolution of the differences between proteins from different environments.Comparing values such as the average oxidation state of carbon with the phylogenetic relationships of gene families that have appeared in different redox conditions [67] might reveal correlations between chemical composition of proteins and evolutionary constraints. Incorporating the energetics of protein-forming chemical reactions in such an analysis would permit even greater integration of available data on the organisms' environments. Comparative calculations of the energetics of overall protein formation reactions is conducive to integrative studies of microbial communities and environments because the energies depend on both molecular sequences and properties of the chemical environment. Extension of such an integrated thermodynamic framework could be a new way forward to quantifying the relationships between chemically distinct environments and their microbial communities."

            "fulltext": "IntroductionEpsilonproteobacteria have been recognized as a physiologically versatile microbial lineage which appears to be relevant for element cycling in ubiquitous environments (cf. [1]). Many Epsilonproteobacteria have a chemolithoautotrophic lifestyle, where the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds or hydrogen can be coupled to oxygen or nitrate reduction or where hydrogen can be oxidized with elemental sulfur as electron acceptor (cf. [1]). Among the Epsilonproteobacteria, Sulfurimonas is a genus of which currently only a few cultured representatives are known including S. autotrophica, S. sp. CVO, S. sp. YK-1, S. paralvinella, S. gotlandica, and S. denitrificans [2]–[7]. They have been isolated from a vast array of (sulfidogenic) habitats including marine sediments [5], deep-sea hydrothermal vent habitats [2], [3], pelagic redoxcline [4] and oil fields [6], [7].\nS. autotrophica was described as mesophilic, sulfur-, sulfide- and thiosulfate-oxidizing chemolithoautotroph [2]. It does not grow on hydrogen [2] and lacks hydrogen uptake activity [8]. S. sp. CVO grows only on sulfide and elemental sulfur with acetate as well as CO2 as sole carbon source [7]. S. sp. YK-1 utilizes sulfide, elemental sulfur, thiosulfate as well as hydrogen [6]. S. paralvinella is a mesophilic sulfur- and hydrogen-oxidizing chemolithoautotroph [3] and its crude extracts exhibit hydrogen uptake activity [8]. Only recently the chemolithoautotrophic S. gotlandica was isolated, which can utilize reduced sulfur species (elemental sulfur, sulfide and thiosulfate) as well as hydrogen [4]. Although S. denitrificans was initially grown on reduced sulfur compounds and characterized as a thiosulfate oxidizer [5], recent sequencing of its genome revealed periplasmic and cytoplasmic [NiFe]-hydrogenases [9]. Based on the information gained through genome sequencing, S. denitrificans could be successfully cultivated with hydrogen as the electron donor (cf. [9]), but hydrogen uptake activities are still not available and the role that hydrogen plays for its growth remains unknown.\nAlthough we know that certain Sulfurimonas species can utilize hydrogen [4], [6], [8], in the past this genus has been referred to as being a sulfur-oxidizing lineage [1]. In some hydrogen-rich hydrothermal environments 16S rRNA genes of Sulfurimonas species have been reported to be particularly abundant [10] and environmental hydrogenase gene sequences resembling those of S. denitrificans have been detected [11]. In summary, this data suggests that hydrogen may be more important for the energy metabolism of S. denitrificans and possibly also for other Sulfurimonas species than currently thought. Since several Sulfurimonas strains can utilize sulfur compounds as well as hydrogen, we here investigate the role that hydrogen plays for growth and metabolism in Sulfurimonas and use S. denitrificans as a model organism.\nMaterials and Methods\nBacterial strains and growth conditions\nBacterial strains and plasmids are listed in Table 1.

Four different incubation conditions were tested: (i) H2/CO2 (80/20%) with thiosulfate, (ii) H2/CO2 (80/20%) without thiosulfate, (iii) N2/CO2 (80%/20%, 1 atm) (Westfalen AG, Münster, Germany) with thiosulfate and (iv) N2/CO2 (80%/20%, 1 atm) without thiosulfate. To monitor the growth of S. denitrificans, the amounts of total protein in 1 mL cell culture at each indicated time point were measured (three times) according to Bradford as previously described [13], [14]. The experiments were performed three times and exhibited the same general trend, i.e. all H2/CO2 experiments with thiosulfate exhibited faster growth initially, but a lower growth yield overall relative to the H2/CO2 experiments without thiosulfate. For selected time points p-values were calculated using the student’s t-test.\n\n\nDetermination of nitrate and thiosulfate\nS. denitrificans was grown under the four different conditions as described above. At each indicated time point 1 mL culture was harvested by centrifugation. Supernatants were kept for nitrate and thiosulfate measurements, and cell pellets for total protein measurements (see above). For the measurement of nitrate in the medium the supernatant was diluted 1:20 with Milli-Q water and from this dilution 25 µL was taken for the measurement. Nitrate concentration was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) via ion-pair chromatography with a LiChrospher RP-18 column (5 µm; 125 by 4 mm; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) [15] and UV detection in an automated system (HPLC-System LaChrom Elite, VWR International GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany). For the measurement of thiosulfate in the medium the supernatant was diluted 1:250 with Milli-Q water and from this dilution 250 µL was taken for the measurement. The amount of thiosulfate was determined by measuring the discoloration of methylene blue spectrophotometrically at 670 nm [16]. The measurements at the different time points were performed with three independent cultures.\n\n\nIn vivo hydrogen measurements\nFor in vivo hydrogen measurements S. denitrificans was grown anaerobically with H2/CO2 (80%/20%, 1 atm) as described above with thiosulfate (18.8 mM) or without thiosulfate. Controls were set up which consisted of all medium ingredients required for S. denitrificans cultivation but without inoculated bacteria. For every hydrogen measurement 0.25 mL of the headspace was extracted, diluted 1:2,300 with nitrogen (5.0; Westfalen AG, Münster, Germany) and from this dilution 2 mL of gas mixture was injected into the gas chromatograph (GC; Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc, Waltham, MA, USA). The amount of hydrogen in the headspace was measured by pulsed discharge ionization detector in the GC. ShinCarbon ST 100/120 (Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA) was used as a column and helium as a carrier gas. These experiments were performed in triplicate. Statistics were performed using the student’s t-test.\n\n\nReverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)\nS. denitrificans was grown anaerobically with H2/CO2 (80%/20%, 1 atm) and thiosulfate as described above. Subsamples (10 mL) of the cultures were taken after three, six and twelve days of incubation. The total RNA was isolated with Presto Mini RNA Bacteria Kit (Geneaid Biotech, Taiwan). DNA was removed by using RTS DNase Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA). cDNAs were synthesized from 700 ng RNA with random primers by using SuperScript VILO MasterMix (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in a final volume of 20 µL. A control reaction lacking reverse transcriptase was performed. PCR amplifications were carried out with cDNA product as template and specific primers (5′-ATATCGTAATGGCGGCAGAG-3′ and 5′-CATCAGGTCCAACAGTATCG-3′ for hydB, Suden_1435, the large subunit of the periplasmic hydrogenase; 5′-TGCGGAATATGTGGACATGC-3′ and 5′-ACTATCGCGTAAGAGGTGTG-3′ for Suden_1437, the large subunit of cytoplasmic hydrogenase; 5′-TGGATTCGCCAAGCAATCTC-3′ and 5′-GCGCCCATCATCTTCACTTC-3′ for rpoD, Suden_1105, RNA polymerase sigma factor) [9] by using SYBR Select Master Mix for CFX (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The relative gene expression was calculated with Bio-Rad CFX Manager (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) and related to the gene expression of rpoD (housekeeping sigma factor). The experiments were conducted three times and the student’s t-test was performed for statistics.\n\n\nHydrogenase activity assay\nS. oneidensis strains and S. denitrificans were grown anaerobically with H2/CO2 (80%/20%, 1 atm) as described above. The hydrogenase activity assays were performed in three parallels. Subcellular fractionations were performed in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Grass Lake, MI, USA) as previously described [17]. The assays were performed as described before [17]–[19] with oxidized methyl viologen (MV, Sigma-Aldrich). In the presence of an active hydrogenase the MV is reduced to MV+ (blue form), which was quantified spectrophotometrically at 602 nm. All measurements were performed at 25°C and the hydrogen uptake activity was calculated by using an extinction coefficient of 5,401 M−1 cm−1 (personal communication, Nicolas Rychlik). The student’s t-test was performed for assessing the statistical relevance of the findings.\n\n\nConstruction of expression vectors\nThe 1.7-kb Suden_1435 (hydB, the large subunit of the periplasmic hydrogenase) [9] was amplified from the genomic DNA of S. denitrificans by using the primers Suden1435F (5′-ATGTCAAAAAGAGTAATAGTAGA-3′) and Suden1435R (5′-TTAAATAGTGCATCCGCCATA-3′). The fragment was ligated with pGEM-T (Promega, Mannheim, Germany), restricted with SacI and SacII, and religated to SacI/SacII restricted pBBR1MCS-2 [20]. The sequence and the direction of gene Suden_1435 were confirmed by sequencing (Eurofins MWG operon, Hamburg, Germany). The plasmids were transferred into S. oneidensis ΔhyaB by tri-parental conjugation with the helper plasmid pRK2013 [21].\n\nResults and Discussion\nGrowth of S. denitrificans on hydrogen and in vivo hydrogen consumption\nTo monitor the growth of S. denitrificans under different conditions, namely (i) H2/CO2 (80%/20%) with thiosulfate (18.8 mM), (ii) H2/CO2 (80%/20%) without thiosulfate, and as controls (iii) N2/CO2 (80%/20%) with thiosulfate (18.8 mM) and (iv) N2/CO2 (80%/20%) without thiosulfate, the amount of total protein was recorded at different growth phases. S. denitrificans cells grown anaerobically in DSMZ medium 113 grew significantly denser (p-value<0.001) when only hydrogen was present relative to when only thiosulfate was offered (Figure 1, Table S1) clearly indicating that besides thiosulfate oxidation, hydrogen oxidation is also used as an energy source in these cultures (Figure 1). In vivo hydrogen consumption measurements with S. denitrificans confirmed that hydrogen was being actively consumed when the headspace of the culture was filled with hydrogen, regardless whether thiosulfate was present or not (Figure 2).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.

In vivo hydrogen consumption in S. denitrificans DSM-1251.S. denitrificans DSM-1251 cells were grown anaerobically in DSMZ medium 113 either with thiosulfate (18.8 mM) or without thiosulfate. On the first day of inoculation, the headspace of each sample was exchanged with H2/CO2 (80%/20%). The H2 concentration in the headspace was measured with gas chromatography. A control experiment was set up to exclude hydrogen leakage from the vessels. Medium = control, medium without inoculated S. denitrificans DSM-1251; S. den. = inoculation with 0.5 mL of S. denitrificans DSM-1251 pre-culture at day 1. Error bars of “Medium” and “S. den.” indicate the standard deviations from three independent experiments.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0106218.g002Based on protein contents, cells which were fed with hydrogen and thiosulfate grew significantly faster within the first three days (0.011 µg protein/µl culture per day) (p-value 0.003) than those fed with hydrogen and lacked thiosulfate (0.002 µg protein/µl culture per day) and reached maximum total protein concentrations of 0.041±0.001 and 0.047±0.003 µg/µl, respectively (Figure 1, Table S1). However, cells in medium with hydrogen in the headspace but without thiosulfate grew significantly denser overall (p-value 0.002) (Table S1). The initial rapid growth of cells grown on hydrogen and thiosulfate during the first three days correlated with a steep decrease in nitrate (19 mM was consumed) (Figure 3A) and thiosulfate (13 mM was consumed) (Figure 3B). By the fourth day all the nitrate was used up, thiosulfate oxidation ceased and cells reached the stationary phase by the fifth day. In contrast, cells grown on hydrogen but without thiosulfate exhibited less rapid growth and only consumed ~6.5 mM nitrate (over 14 days) and cells entered the stationary phase late, namely after 11 days. Also, significantly less hydrogen was consumed in cultures where thiosulfate was supplemented (30% of hydrogen consumed after 14 days of cultivation, i.e. ~11 mM) than in those lacking thiosulfate (65% of hydrogen consumed after 14 days of cultivation, i.e. 23 mM) (p-value 0.001) (Figure 2, Table S2).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 3.

Error bars indicate the standard deviations from measurements of three cultures.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0106218.g003Taken together, these data demonstrate that hydrogen can indeed serve as an electron donor for the growth of S. denitrificans and that under the conditions provided it can grow faster and denser with hydrogen than with thiosulfate. In contrast to experiments with S. paralvinella, where hydrogen is only consumed when reduced sulfur compounds are available [3], S. denitrificans can grow with hydrogen without reduced sulfur sources being present.\n\n\nHydrogenase transcript in S. denitrificans\nGenome sequencing of S. denitrificans revealed hydrogenases on its genome [9]: it encodes the hyd operon with one cytoplasmic hydrogenase, one membrane-bound hydrogenase, and accessory proteins for the hydrogenase assembly. The cytoplasmic hydrogenase has been posited to reduce electron acceptors with very negative redox midpoint potentials and may provide low-potential electrons to the rTCA [9]. If this proves true the need for a reverse electron transport is circumvented because reducing power can be generated directly and as a consequence the efficiency of growth is increased [9]. When cells were grown in the presence of hydrogen and thiosulfate, transcripts of the cytoplasmic hydrogenase were recovered (demonstrated by RT-PCR, data not shown). In many proteobacteria such as Wolinella succinogenes and Shewanella oneidensis, the periplasmic [NiFe]-hydrogenase serves as the major hydrogen uptake hydrogenase (Group I hydrogenase) [22]. This group of hydrogenases is capable of supporting growth with hydrogen as an energy source. They catalyze the oxidation of hydrogen to protons and electrons. The oxidation of hydrogen is coupled to the reduction of electron acceptors with the recovery of energy in the form of a proton motive force [23]. In S. denitrificans Suden_1435 encodes for the catalytic large subunit (HydB) and Suden_1436 for the small subunit (HydA) of the group I periplasmic [NiFe]-hydrogenase [9]. Our RT-qPCR illustrated that Suden_1435 (hydB) is indeed transcribed in S. denitrificans (Figure 4). RT-qPCR performed on the total RNA from S. denitrificans grown in the presence of hydrogen and thiosulfate further demonstrated that hydB was transcribed during the first 10-days of growth but then its transcription level decreased significantly (p-value<0.005) (Figure 4). The transcription level appeared to follow the general trend of growth of S. denitrificans (Figure 1, Figure 4). When S. denitrificans was in the exponential growth phase, the transcription level of the hydrogenases was highest and started to decline when the stationary growth phase was reached.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 4.  Transcript of hydB (Suden_1435) in S. denitrificans DSM-1251.S. denitrificans DSM-1251 cells were grown in DSMZ medium 113 with thiosulfate (18.8 mM) and H2/CO2 (80%/20%) in the headspace. The relative transcription levels of hydB were quantified by RT-qPCR and normalized to the reference gene rpoD (housekeeping sigma factor). The transcription level of hydB after 3 days was set as 1. Error bars denote standard deviations from three independent experiments.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0106218.g004\n\nHydrogenase activity of S. denitrificans HydB\nTo study the hydrogen uptake activity in vitro, we performed the activity assay with the soluble and membrane fractions of S. denitrificans. No hydrogen uptake activity was detected in the soluble fraction at the sampled time point (data not shown), although a cytoplasmic hydrogenase is encoded on the S. denitrificans genome [9] and transcripts of the cytoplasmic hydrogenase were recovered. The hydrogen uptake activity in the membrane fraction was 187±7 nmol of H2 oxidized (mg of protein)−1 min−1 (Figure 5), when S. denitrificans was grown with hydrogen but without thiosulfate in the medium. This is roughly 10-fold lower than hydrogen uptake activity measured in S. paralvinella [8]. However, the hydrogen uptake activity from S. denitrificans was higher than the hydrogen uptake activity detected in other proteobacteria, e.g., Gamaproteobacterium Hydrogenovibrio marinus [49 nmol of H2 oxidized (mg of protein)−1 min−1] and Betaproteobacterium Cupriavidus metallidurans [previously known as Alcaligenes eutrophus, 42 nmol of H2 oxidized (mg of protein)−1 min−1] at 37°C (in the same buffer we used) [18]. When S. denitrificans was grown in the medium with thiosulfate, an activity of 85±12 nmol of H2 oxidized (mg of protein)−1 min−1 was detected in the membrane fraction (Figure 5). This activity is significantly lower (p-value<0.001, roughly 2-times, Table S2) than the hydrogen uptake activity we measured for cells grown with hydrogen but without thiosulfate. These results are in line with the lower in vivo hydrogen consumption for S. denitrificans grown with thiosulfate (Figure 2) and together with thiosulfate consumption measurements (Figure 3B) suggest that if thiosulfate is present, under the provided conditions, S. denitrificans oxidized thiosulfate besides hydrogen which appears to result in lower hydrogen requirement.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 5.  Hydrogen uptake activity of the native and recombinant hydrogenase (HydB) from S. denitrificans.Hydrogen uptake activity was measured in the membrane fractions of S. denitrificans grown without and with thiosulfate (18.8 mM) and for the recombinant version of the large subunit (HydB). The large subunit of the periplasmic hydrogenase (hydB) was cloned into the vector pBBR1MCS-2 and expressed heterologously in S. oneidensis ΔhyaB. The empty vector in S. oneidensis ΔhyaB was used as negative control. Error bars denote standard deviations from three independent measurements.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0106218.g005To ensure that the periplasmic hydrogenase is responsible for the hydrogen uptake activity we cloned the large subunit of the periplasmic hydrogenase (hydB) in the vector pBBR1MCS-2. Recombinant expression of hydB demonstrated an activity of 444±49 nmol of H2 oxidized (mg of protein)−1 min−1 in the membrane fraction (Figure 5). This was in fact twice as high as the non-recombinant expression in S. denitrificans grown without thiosulfate, but can be explained by the copy number of the plasmid: pBBR1MCS-2 is a medium-copy-number plasmid [24] and thus several copies of the plasmid are present in the cell expressing the hydrogenase. In summary, these results indicate that the periplasmic hydrogenase is most likely if not solely responsible for the measured hydrogen uptake activity in the crude extracts.\n\n\nThe role of hydrogen for S. denitrificans metabolism\nS. denitrificans clearly exhibits different growth behaviors, hydrogen and nitrate consumption and hydrogen uptake activity depending on whether the cells are grown on hydrogen with or without thiosulfate. This is expressed in rapid growth, initially, but overall lower cell numbers, higher nitrate consumption (to the point of nitrate limitation), but lower hydrogen consumption (two-fold) and lower hydrogen uptake activity (two-fold) when thiosulfate is supplemented to the hydrogen medium. The reaction 5H2+2NO3−+2H+>>6H2O+N2 yields −959 kJ/reaction whereas 5S2O32−+8NO3−+H2O>>10SO42−+2H++4N2 yields -3926 kJ/reaction [25]. Hence, roughly four times more energy can be gained if thiosulfate is oxidized, but then also four times more nitrate is consumed relative to the reaction involving hydrogen. Organisms without the need of a reverse electron transport require 1060 kJ catabolic energy to fix one mol of carbon in biomass [26]. Assuming that with and without thiosulfate in the hydrogen medium the cytoplasmic hydrogenase catalyzes the reduction of NAD with hydrogen, thereby creating reducing power directly, theoretically considerably more biomass can be synthesized when thiosulfate is oxidized (3.7 mol carbon per five molecules thiosulfate) than when hydrogen is oxidized (0.9 mol carbon per five molecules hydrogen) with nitrate. This likely explains why the cells grown on thiosulfate grow faster initially than the cells grown on hydrogen without thiosulfate.\nIn the growth experiments with hydrogen and thiosulfate, according to the stoichiometry, the 13 mM consumed thiosulfate, if coupled to nitrate reduction, would theoretically account for the consumption of 19 mM nitrate, which is the measured amount of nitrate that was utilized in this experiment (Figure 3A). This would suggest that no nitrate reduction coupled hydrogen oxidation occurs, although 11 mM of hydrogen was used (Figure 2). While some of this hydrogen is likely essential to directly reduce NAD to produce reducing power directly, the hydrogen uptake activity of the periplasmic hydrogenase (although two-fold lower than when cells are grown without thiosulfate) (Figure 5) strongly suggests that energy generation in cells under these conditions is likely also linked to the build up of a proton motive force during hydrogen oxidation. Two scenarios could explain this discrepancy: based on S. denitrificans available genome information, genes encoding proteins that may be involved in the reduction of sulfur compounds including thiosulfate have been identified [9], which may account for some of the used thiosulfate. Hence, some of the nitrate may indeed be available for hydrogen oxidation coupled nitrate reduction. Hydrogen oxidation may also be coupled to sulfate reduction. S. denitrificans has an operon that encodes proteins of sulfate reduction [9]. However, the energy yield of 4H2+ SO42- +2H+ >> H2S+4H2O is considerably lower (154 kJ/reaction, [25]) than for nitrate reduction coupled hydrogen oxidation. However, based on the rapid cell growth in cultures with hydrogen and thiosulfate relative to cultures without thiosulfate we believe that thiosulfate oxidation represents the major mode of energy generation in these hydrogen incubations supplemented with thiosulfate and that under these conditions most of the consumed hydrogen is related to creating reducing power directly.\nWhen no thiosulfate is present, the cells revert to generating energy from hydrogen oxidation and twice as much hydrogen is consumed (Figure 2) and hydrogen uptake activity is doubled (Figure 5). In the experiments where cells were grown on hydrogen without thiosulfate, 6.5 mM nitrate was consumed when cells reached the stationary phase, which, according to the stoichiometry, could fuel the oxidation of ~16 mM hydrogen. In these cultivations around 23 mM hydrogen was used leaving theoretically ~7 mM hydrogen unaccounted for. As suggested above some of this hydrogen is likely used to circumvent the need for reversed electron transport, but the two-fold higher hydrogen uptake activity in these cultures also hint to the larger requirement of energy generation through hydrogen oxidation. Under these conditions some of the hydrogen oxidation may also be coupled to sulfate reduction - it has been postulated that the operon structure encoding the proteins for sulfate reduction can be turned on or off depending on the concentration of reduced inorganic sulfur species in the environment [9]. The lower energy yield through hydrogen oxidation coupled to nitrate or sulfate reduction relative to thiosulfate oxidation explains the slower growth yields. Since these cells are not limited by nitrate, as those in the hydrogen incubations with thiosulfate, growth can proceed to eventually reaching higher biomass than in the cultures with thiosulfate, which started being limited by nitrate after 3 days.\nFinally, based on our experiments we cannot state how much of the consumed nitrate is related to nitrate reduction coupled to thiosulfate oxidation versus hydrogen oxidation or how much hydrogen is used in the experiments for energy generation through nitrate or sulfate reduction or for production of reducing power. Further experiments will be needed to address these questions in detail.\n\nOur study provides the first experimentally shown evidence that S. denitrificans can express a functional hydrogen uptake hydrogenase and use hydrogen as electron donor. In fact, in our experiments S. denitrificans grew faster and denser on hydrogen than on thiosulfate alone. The cells could also gain energy through the oxidation of hydrogen in the absence of reduced sulfur compounds. Although thiosulfate oxidation yields more energy per reaction than hydrogen oxidation does, it also uses four times more nitrate than when hydrogen oxidation is coupled to nitrate reduction. Thus, when the cells oxidize thiosulfate they become limited by nitrate quicker than if they oxidize hydrogen. The many environmental sequences available in the databases resembling those of S. denitrificans may in fact not be solely associated with sulfur metabolism but may also represent microbes that are involved in hydrogen turnover. In fact, in the environment under nitrate limiting conditions hydrogen oxidation may be a favored metabolism."

                "\nMouse aldehyde oxidase (mAOX1) forms a homodimer and belongs to the xanthine oxidase family of molybdoenzymes which are characterized by an essential equatorial sulfur ligand coordinated to the molybdenum atom. In general, mammalian AOs are characterized by broad substrate specificity and an yet obscure physiological function. To define the physiological substrates and the enzymatic characteristics of mAOX1, we established a system for the heterologous expression of the enzyme in Eschericia coli. The recombinant protein showed spectral features and a range of substrate specificity similar to the native protein purified from mouse liver. The EPR data of recombinant mAOX1 were similar to those of AO from rabbit liver, but differed from the homologous xanthine oxidoreductase enzymes. Site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids Val806, Met884 and Glu1265 at the active site resulted in a drastic decrease in the oxidation of aldehydes with no increase in the oxidation of purine substrates. The double mutant V806E/M884R and the single mutant E1265Q were catalytically inactive enzymes regardless of the aldehyde or purine substrates tested. Our results show that only Glu1265 is essential for the catalytic activity by initiating the base-catalyzed mechanism of substrate oxidation. In addition, it is concluded that the substrate specificity of molybdo-flavoenzymes is more complex and not only defined by the three characterized amino acids in the active site.\n"

            "fulltext": "IntroductionThe molybdenum cofactor (Moco) is found in a class of widely distributed proteins collectively known as molybdoenzymes. Moco containing enzymes are divided into three separate groups on the basis of structure, cofactor and spectroscopic characteristics: the dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) reductase, the xanthine oxidase, and the sulfite oxidase family [1]. Members of the xanthine oxidase family comprise xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH, EC 1.17.1. 4), xanthine oxidase (XO, EC 1.17.3.2), and aldehyde oxidase (AO, EC 1.2.3.1). All these proteins are characterized by an equatorial sulfur ligand at the Moco essential for the enzymatic activity [2], and belong to the class of complex molybdo-flavoenzymes (MFEs) containing two nonidentical [2Fe-2S] clusters and FAD as additional cofactors [3], [4].\nVertebrate xanthine oxidoreductases (XOR) are the products of single orthologous genes and are the key enzymes in the catabolism of purines, oxidizing hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to the terminal catabolite uric acid, with the concomitant reduction of NAD+ (XDH) or O2 (XO) [5].\nThe gene family of vertebrate AOs is much more complex and the corresponding protein products have been the object of fewer studies. While the human genome is characterized by a single functionally active AO gene (AOX1), the complement of homologous genes in rodents and other mammals is more complex [4]. Marsupials and rodents contain the highest number of functionally active AO genes, which generally cluster on the same chromosomal region at a short distance from one another [4]. The rodent AO gene cluster consists of the human AOX1 orthologue, and three highly related genes named AO homologue-1 (AOH1), -2 (AOH2), and -3 (AOH3) [4], [6]–[8]. In other vertebrates and mammals the number of functionally active loci varies, as a consequence of gene duplication and suppression events [4]. The multiple AO isoforms are expressed tissue-specifically [4], [7], and may recognize distinct substrates and carry out different physiological tasks. The overall level of amino acid identity between AO and XOR proteins is approximately 50%, which indicates that the two proteins originated from a common ancestral precursor [3].\nWhile the biochemical function of XOR is well established, the biochemical and physiological functions of AO are still largely obscure [4]. Monogenic deficits of mammalian AO isoforms have not been reported to date. In humans, AOX1 and XOR do not seem to play a vital role, as genetic deficiencies in the Moco sulfurase (MCSF) gene, causing a defect of both enzymes, are associated with mild symptoms such as the formation of kidney stones [9], [10]. AOs in general are characterized by a broad substrate specificity and play an important role in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotica [3]. In animals, AOs have a significant toxicological role, detoxifying xenobiotics of wide structural diversity. The enzymes oxidize aromatic aza-heterocycles containing a –CH = N− chemical function (e.g. phtalazine and purines), aromatic or non-aromatic charged aza-heterocycles with a –CH = N+ =  moiety (e.g. N1-methylnicotinamide and N-methylphthalazinium) or aldehydes, such as benzaldehyde, retinal and vanillin [3]. AO and XOR share some common substrates and the relative selectivity of the two types of enzymes has been systematically reviewed [11]. AO may have a role in the degradation of vitamins like nicotinamide and pyridoxal or in the oxidation of all-trans retinaldehyde to all-trans retinoic acid, the active metabolite of vitamin A [3]. Upon oxidation of aldehyde substrates, AO produces significant amounts of highly toxic reactive oxygen species, O2.− and hydrogen peroxide [12], [13].\nThe reaction mechanism of substrate oxidation of MFEs has been only described in detail for Rhodobacter capsulatus XDH [14], a bacterial XDH sharing high similarities to eukaryotic XOR both at the structural level and on the basis of amino acid sequence identity [15], [16]. In the oxidized enzyme, the metal is in the Mo(VI) oxidation state, bearing an oxo ( = O), an hydroxo (-OH) and an equatorial sulfido ( = S) ligand. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that GluB730 is a fundamental residue for the catalytic reaction by abstracting a proton from the Mo-OH group, which then nucleophilically attacks the substrate carbon atom to be hydroxylated [14]. Two other conserved residues at the active site of XORs, GluB232 and ArgB310, are involved in substrate binding and transition state stabilization [14], [17]. In mouse AOX1 (mAOX1), the glutamate acting as an active site base is also highly conserved (E1265), however, the glutamate involved in substrate binding is exchanged by a valine (V806), and the arginine involved in transition state stabilization is exchanged to a methionine (M884) [3].\nTo study the importance of these amino acids in substrate specificity for AOX1, we established a system for heterologous expression of mAOX1 in E. coli. To ensure a high level of incorporation of the sulfido ligand at the Moco site, mouse MCSF (mMCSF) was cloned and coexpressed in this system. The recombinant enzyme was characterized by spectroscopic methods and steady state kinetics. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we exchanged the amino acids present at the active site of mAOX1 by the ones found in XOR. For comparison reasons, we introduced the reverse amino acid exchanges to the active site of R. capsulatus XDH. We determined the kinetic parameters of wild-type and mutant mAOX1 using different aldehyde and purine substrates, gaining insights into the molecular determinants guiding substrate specificity in XOR and AOX1.\nResults\nHeterologous Expression, Purification and Characterization of mAOX1\nSeveral heterologous expression systems for mammalian AOs have been described. However a main drawback of all these systems is the low catalytic acivity of the purified enzymes due to a low Moco content [18]–[20]. To overcome this problem, we designed an expression system that allowed the simultaneous expression of mAOX1 and mMCSF in the E. coli TP1000 strain, and ensured a higher level of sulfurated Moco insertion into the enzyme [21].\nRecombinant mAOX1 was purified from a 12-liter E. coli culture using sequential Ni-NTA chromatography, size exclusion chromatography and benzamidine sepharose affinity chromatography. The purification protocol used for mAOX1 is summarized in Table 1. The overall purification from the soluble fraction was more than 23-fold with a yield of 0.17%, and the final specific activity with benzalyldehyde of the purified protein was 2.3 U/mg. This compares well to the activity reported for mAOX1 purified from mouse liver [7]. We demonstrated that the low increase in specific activity after Ni-NTA is due to the intrinsic aldehyde oxidizing activity of E. coli enzymes of the xanthine oxidase family present in the crude extract (data not shown). Size exclusion chromatography of the purified protein resulted in a single peak with an approximate molecular mass of 300 kDa, showing that the protein existed as a homodimer in solution (data not shown). SDS polyacrylamide gels performed under reducing conditions demonstrated the presence of one major band with a size of 150 kDa after purification (Fig. 1). In these experimental conditions three additional bands with sizes of 120 kDa, 80 kDa, and 50 kDa were also observed (Fig. 1). Electrospray mass spectrometry analysis of the respective gel slices revealed that these bands were degradation products of mAOX1 (data not shown). These bands were also observed in AO purified from other sources, e.g. in AO purified from rat liver [12]. As observed in our data, AO purified from rat liver displayed several bands of sizes of 150, 130, 80, and 45 kDa on SDS- polyacrylamide gels, but not after native-PAGE [12]. Thus we conclude, that the degradaion products occur due the reductive conditions during the SDS-PAGE.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.

Purification of recombinant mAOX1 after expression in E. coli TP1000 cells.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0005348.t001The visible absorption spectrum (Fig. 2) of recombinant mAOX1 is similar to those of mAOH1 purified from mouse liver and shows the presence of FeS and FAD as prosthetic groups [8]. The iron content was measured by ICP-OES and showed a saturation of 90% (Table 2). Since the ratio of 450:550 in the UV-Vis spectrum was shown to be 3, this implicates that the protein is fully saturated with FAD [1]. The Moco content of mAOX1 was quantified after its conversion to Form A and related to the molybdenum content of the protein (Table 2), revealing that no demolybdo-mAOX1 was present in the purified fractions. To determine the content of the terminal sulfur ligand required for mAOX1 activity, the cyanolysable sulfur was quantified and in addition, absorption spectra of oxidized mAOX1 and benzaldehyde reduced enzyme were recorded under anaerobic conditions (data not shown). From the reduction spectra the amount of active mAOX1 was calculated to be 20%. While purified mAOX1 was 70% saturated with Moco (Table 2), the purified enzyme was only 20% saturated with the sulfido ligand required for enzyme activity.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 2.

The spectra show signals from the reduced FAD cofactor to the flavin semiquinone and from some remaining Mo(V). Most prominent are however the characteristic EPR signals assigned to the two iron sulphur centers FeSI and FeSII, which are similar for all members of the xanthine oxidase family that have been described to date [1], [22]. FeSI has EPR properties showing an almost axial g-tensor, similar to those of many other [2Fe-2S] proteins, being fully developed at relatively high temperatures (60 K), while FeSII has unusual EPR properties for [2Fe-2S] species with a strongly rhombic g-tensor, showing broad lines and being only observed at much lower temperatures (20 K). The g-values and linewidths were evaluated by simulating the superimposed spectra of FeSI, FeSII and reduced FAD (Fig. 3) using the program EasySpin [23]. The double-integrated simulated spectra for the single iron-sulfur clusters display a ratio of 1:1 indicating the presence of both clusters FeSI and FeSII in the same amount in the protein. The obtained g-values are given in Table 3. The flavin semiquinone (FAD) has been simulated by using an isotropic g-value of 2.0 and a linewidth of 1.9 mT. This linewidth is comparable with that from other flavins [1], [22]. The Moco (MoV) has been neglected in the simulations.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 3.

The spectrum of the oxidized wild-type enzyme exhibited strong negative dichroic bands at approximately 350–400 nm and 520–580 nm, and intensive positive bands between 400 and 500 nm (Fig. 4). From the various maxima and infections, transitions can be identified at 378 (−), 434 (+), 474 (+), and 556 (−) nm. Upon reduction with dithionite, the spectrum changed markedly with less intense transitions at 370 (−), 408 (+), and 478 (−) nm. The visible CD-spectra of reduced and oxidized mAOX1 are very similar in shape and intensity to those of XOR [24], [25], showing that both FeSI and FeSII are present in the recombinant enzyme.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 4.

The lower Moco content of the purified variants may be due to the modified purification protocol necessary for the purification of these mAOX1 variants, which did not bind to the benzamidine sepharose. The iron content of the variants varied between 83–108%, reflecting that the FeS clusters were not influenced by the amino acid exchanges at the active site (Table 2). In addition, the variants showed almost identical CD-spectra in comparison to wild-type mAOX (data not shown).\nWith the exception of retinaldehyde, steady state kinetics of wild-type mAOX1 were performed by varying the concentrations of the substrates benzaldehyde, phtalazine, acetaldehyde, xanthine and hypoxanthine, and by using DCPIP as electron acceptor (Experimental procedures). In consideration of the fact that the protein was only 20% active, the enzyme activities compared well to the values obtained for native mAOX1 [7]. In particular the kcat values determined with benzaldehyde were almost superimposable (Table 4). The kcat values determined for retinaldehyde and acetaldehyde were a little higher in comparison to native mAOX1, but were in the same range. The substrates with the highest catalytic efficiency were the aromatic aldehydes phtalazine, benzaldehyde and retinaldehyde. Acetaldehyde showed the lowest catalytic efficiency. The purine substrates xanthine and hypoxanthine were not used by the recombinant mAOX1 under our assay conditions.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 4.  Steady-state kinetic parameters of recombinant mAOX1 and variants with different aldehyde and purine substrates.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0005348.t004The catalytic parameters for the mAOX1 variants E1265Q, V806E, M884R, and V806E/M884R were also determined. As shown in Table 4, variants E1265Q and V806E/M884R were unable to metabolize any of the aldehyde and purine substrates tested. While the corresponding kcat values were generally decreased, the Km value for benzaldehyde, phtalazine and acetaldehyde were drastically increased by introducing the V806E amino acid exchange in mAOX1. For the variant V806E, the catalytic efficiency decreased by a factor of 10 for benzaldehyde, retinaldehyde and acetaldehyde, while the value was only decreased 3-fold for phtalzine as substrate. Thus, the affinity for small and symmetric aromatic aldehydes are affected by this mutation, while the affinity for more hydrophobic aldehydes like retinaldehyde was increased, albeit with a concomitant decrease in kcat. In contrast, the M884R variant was inactive with phtalazine and acetaldehyde as substrates, and for both benzaldehyde and retinaldehyde kcat and Km were decreased.\n\n\nComparison of steady state parameters of the reverse amino acid exchanges (EB232V, RB310M, and EB232V/RB310M) introduced into R. capsulatus XDH\nThe catalytic mechanism of R. capsulatus XDH was proposed to involve three amino acids at the active site: GluB730 is thought to act as an active site base in the initial step of the reaction, while GluB232 is involved in substrate binding and transition state stabilization and RB310 is involved in transition state stabilization and orientation of the substrate at the active site. Since the catalytic mechanism of R. capsulatus XDH is well characterized, we compared the steady state kinetic data derived for wild-type mAOX1 and active-site variants with amino acid exchanges introduced into the active site of R. capsulatus XDH to reverse the amino acids found at the active site of XDH to the ones conserved in mAOX1. Thus, the XDH variants EB232V, RB310M, and the double variant EB232V/RB310M were generated.\nAs shown in Table 2, the Moco content of the purified XDH proteins was reduced and varied from 43%–63%, depending on the introduced amino acid exchange. Steady state kinetics of XDH were performed by varying the concentrations of the substrates benzaldehyde, phtalazine, retinaldehyde, acetaldehyde, xanthine and hypoxanthine, by using DCPIP as electron acceptor. Compared to wild-type XDH, the activity of the variants with purine substrates was drastically decreased, while oxidation of aldehydes as substrate was increased (Table 5). We were able to sucessfully purify the XDH-EB232V/RB310M double variant. This variant was devoid of purine oxidizing activity (Table 5), however, in contrast, aldehydes were oxidized with a higher turnover number in comparison to wild-type XDH. In general, the kcat values of the three XDH variants for all aldehyde substrates tested was increased, while the Km was decreased for benzadehyde and phtalazine and increased for retinaldehyde and acetaldehyde. Overall, the results obtained for R. capsulatus XDH show that the two amino acids at the active site switch the substrate specificity from purines to aldehydes. However, the reverse was not true for amino acids exchanges in the active site of mAOX1, showing that the oxidation of aldehydes is more complex.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 5.  Steady-state kinetic parameters of recombinant R. capsulatus XDH and variants with different aldehyde and purine substrates.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0005348.t005\nDiscussionHere, we report a system for the heterologous expression of mAOX1 in E. coli. Our system tried to overcome one of the main problems associated with the expression of recombinant mammalian MFEs in bacteria, i.e. the production of large proportions of inactive demolybdo and desulfo enzymes, as observed in the case of human XOR [20]. To ensure a higher sulfuration level of AOX1, we engineered E. coli for the simultaneous synthesis of the mMCSF and mAOX1 proteins. After coexpression with mMCSF, mAOX1 contained a 50% higher level of the terminal sulfido ligand of Moco (data not shown), although only 20% of the purified enzyme existed in the catalytically active form. This suggested two possibilities: either the conditions for the expression of both proteins have to be further optimized, or the sulfuration of Moco in bacteria and eukaryotes is different. Thus in prokaryotes, sulfuration of Moco precedes insertion into MFEs [26]. In eukaryotes, like Arabidopsis thaliana it was speculated that Moco sulfurase sulfurates Moco already bound to MFEs [27]. Thus it remains possible that due to this difference, heterologous expression of mammalian MFE's in E. coli will not give rise to a complete sulfurated enzyme. However, we also tried expression of AOX1 in Pichia pastoris, and this expression system also did not give rise to a higher sulfuration level of AOX1. Thus, it also remains possible, that part of the sulfido ligand of mAOX1 is exchanged to an oxo-ligand during purification of the enzyme.\nThe recombinant mAOX1 displayed similar catalytic properties in comparison to the enzyme purified from mouse liver [7]. This demonstrates that the protein was correctly folded in mMCSF engineered E. coli cells and could be used for more detailed analyses. The EPR spectra of mAOX1 were found to be very similar to those from the bacterial XDH characterized from R. capsulatus, showing a rather axial signal for FeSI [28]. There are only subtle differences in the g-values and linewidths, in particular for the FeSII center, that may be the consequence of small changes in bond distances and angles of the ligands of the respective FeS centers [28]. Nevertheless, the overall close similarity of the EPR parameters indicated the presence of the same ligands and similar geometries of the two redox centers in mAOX1 and R. capsulatus XDH. The spectroscopic charactaristics of mAOX1 and rabbit liver AO were also similar [29] and are consistent with an axial signal for FeSI.\nEukaryotic XOR and AO are similar in protein structure and prosthetic group composition, but have different characteristics of substrate specificity both at the molybdenum center and at the FAD center [3], [11]. While mAOX1 is a true oxidase using molecular oxygen as electron acceptor at the FAD site, XOR exists in two interconvertible forms: NAD+ is the substrate for the XDH form of XOR, while after proteolytic cleavage or intramolecular disulfide formation, the XO form is generated, which uses O2 instead of NAD+. The hydroxylation of aldehyde and purine substrates is catalyzed at the molybdenum center in both AO and XOR. However, the former catalyzes the hydroxylation of aldehydes more efficiently than the latter [11]. On the other hand, purines such as hypoxanthine and xanthine are good substrates of XOR, but poor substrates of AO. The crystal structure of R. capsulatus XDH with alloxanthine bound to the active site [15], in addtion to site directed mutagenesis studies [14], proposed that the purine substrates are bound and oxidized as follows: Catalysis is initiated by abstraction of a proton from the Mo-OH group by the conserved active site GluB730, followed by the nucleophilic attack on the carbon of the substrate and the concomitant hydride transfer to the Mo = S of the molybdenum center [14]. This reaction yields an intermediate with the hydroxylated product coordinated to the molybdenum via the newly introduced hydroxyl group. The catalytic sequence is completed by displacement of the bound product from the molybdenum coordination sphere by hydroxide from solvent. This is followed by intramolecular electron transfer to the FeS and FAD cofactors, as well as deprotonation of the Mo-SH to give the oxidized form of the molybdenum center. In addition, GluB232 and ArgB310 of R. capsulatus XDH were shown to be involved in the binding, orientation and transition state stabilization of the substrate [14], [17].\nA similar reaction mechanism as the one described for XOR have been proposed for AOs [4], although, this proposal has never been supported by experimental data based on site-directed mutagenesis. Heterologous expression of mAOX1 in E. coli enabled us to study the involvement of specific residues at the active site in more detail for the first time. We exchanged residues Glu1265, Val806, and Met884 to the ones identified in the active site of XORs. For direct comparison reasons, the reverse amino acid exchanges were introduced to the active site of R. capsulatus XDH. Our results showed that the amino acid exchanges in XDH resulted in the complete loss of activity towards purine substrates for the EB232V/RB310M double variant, and a higher activity with aldehyde substrates. In contrast to Yamaguchi et al. [20], we were able to purify the EB232V/RB310M double XDH variant. However, the reverse was not the case for amino acid exchanges in mAOX1. The amino acid exchanges V806E/M884R in mAOX1 resulted in a complete loss of enzyme activity with both purine and aldehyde substrates. Both residues at the active site of mAOX1 seem to be important for the binding of substrates, since the M884R variant either completely lost the activity with phtalazine or acetaldehyde as substrates, or the activity with retinaldehyde and benzaldehyde was drastically reduced, with a concomitant increase of Km for benzaldehyde. In general, the V806E exchange resulted in an increase in Km for most substrates (except retinaldehyde) and in a decrease in kcat. Thus, while the ability to bind and utilize aldehyde substrates was decreased by converting the two residues to the ones found in XDH, purines were still not converted by the mAOX1 variants. While in XDH the two residues seem to determine which substrates are efficiently bound at the active site, in mAOX1 more factors determine the binding and conversion of substrates. mAOX1 seems to be more adapted to aldehyde substrates and the substrate specificity can not be converted back to purine substrates by two amino acid exchanges at the active site. The active site of XDH is deeply buried in the enzyme, but reachable through a funnel-shaped cavity that is wider on the surface. Hydrophobic residues, able to accommodate the ring structures of the aromatic substrates dominate the channel in XOR (e.g. LeuB303, ProB306, PheB344, PheB459 in R. capsulatus XDH) [15]. These residues are exchanged to more bulky, charged or hydrophobic amino acids in mAOX1: Glu877, Trp880, Phe918, and Ile1013 [3]. It is possible that the aromatic purine residues analyzed in this study, are unable to enter the active site of mAOX1.\nFinally, the mAOX1-E1265Q variant was catalytically inactive. This result is consistent with an essential catalytic role for this residue [4]. Like in XOR, Glu1265 of mAOX1 may function as an active-site base to abstract a proton from the Mo-OH leading to the nucleophilic attack on the aldehyde substrate molecule, which is followed by a hydride transfer to give the transition state intermediate (Fig. 6). The roles of residues Met884 and Val806 are proposed to be the stabilization of substate binding. Since the aromatic aldehydes tested in this study are symmetric, the orientation of the substrate at the active site is not as important as in XOR [17].\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 6.  Proposed base catalyzed mechanism for mAOX1.E1265 acts as an active site base that abstracts a proton from the Mo-OH group, which in turn undertakes a nucleophilic attack on the substrate benzaldehyde. After hydride transfer to the Mo = S group, the initial intermediate breaks down, with the transient formation of a paramagnetic MoV species, followed by displacement of product by a water molecule to return to the starting LMoVIOS(OH) state. The roles of residues Met884 and Val806 are stabilization of substrate binding.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0005348.g006In total, the established expression system of mAOX1 in E. coli can further be used for detailed site-directed mutagenesis and structure-function studies of mammalian MFEs. In future studies it is planned to characterize the homologues of mAOX1 in rodents in more detail. Analysis of substrate specificities will give insights into the potential physiological roles of these enzymes.\nE.coli TP1000 (ΔmobAB) cells [30] were used for the coexpression of mAOX1 wild-type and variants with mMCSF. E. coli expression cultures were grown in LB medium under aerobic conditions at 30°C for 24 h. Ampicillin (50 µg/ml) chloramphenicol (150 µg/ml), sodium molybdate (1 mM) and isopropyl-ß-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) (20 µM) were used when required.The cDNA of mAOX1 was cloned from mouse CD1 liver [31], using primers designed to allow cloning into the NdeI-SalI sites of the expression vector pTrcHis [32]. The resulting plasmid was designated pSL205, and expresses mAOX1 as a N-terminal fusion protein with a His6-tag. By using PCR mutagenesis the amino acid exchanges V806E, M884R, V806E/M884R and E1265Q were introduced into mAOX1. The mMCSF cDNA fragment was cloned from mouse liver using primers for the cloning into the NdeI-XhoI sites of the expression vector pACYCDuet-1 (Novagen), and the resulting plasmid was designated pSS110.For heterologous expression in E. coli, pSL205 and pSS110 were transformed into TP1000 cells [30]. To express recombinant proteins, cells were grown at 30°C in LB medium supplemented with 150 µg/mL ampicillin, 50 µg/ml chloramphenicol, 1 mM molybdate, and 20 µM IPTG. After 24 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 300 mM NaCl and disrupted by several passages through a French Press cell. The supernatant was mixed with 3.5 mL of Ni-nitrilotriacetic (NTA) resin per 12 liters of cell growth. The slurry was transferred to a column and washed with 10 column volumes of 50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0 containing 10 mM imidazole, followed by a wash with 10 column volumes of the same buffer containing 20 mM imidazole. His6-tagged mAOX1 was eluted with 50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0 containing 250 mM imidazole. This fraction was dialyzed over night in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mM EDTA. The mAOX1 protein was further applied to a Superose 12 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). The eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the ones containing mAOX1 were combined and dialyzed against 100 mM Glycin, 200 mM NaCl, pH 9.0. The mAOX1 protein was mixed with 2 ml of benzamidine sepharose (GE Healthcare), pre-equilibrated in the same buffer. Following 4 h of incubation, the resin was washed 3 times with 10 ml of the equilibration buffer to remove unbound proteins. Absorbed proteins were eluted with 20 ml of equilibration buffer containing 30 mM benzamidine. Subsequently, the eluted protein was dialyzed into 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 1 mM EDTA. The protein solution was then concentrated by ultrafiltration. Absorbance spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-2401 dual-wavelength double-beam spectrophotometer. Purified proteins were stored at −70°C until use. The mAOX1 variants were expressed under the same conditions as the mAOX1 wild-type and purified by Ni-NTA and Superose 12 chromatography.R. capsulatus wild-type XDH was purified as described previously [14]. Using PCR mutagenesis amino acid exchanges EB232V, RB310M, and the double variant EB232V/RB310M were introduced into R. capsulatus XDH. The generated XDH variants were purified by Ni-NTA, Q-Sepharose, and Superose 12 chromatography as described previously for other XDH variants [14]. The purified enzymes were concentrated by ultrafiltration, gel filtered using a PD-10 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM DTT, pH 7.5 and stored at −70°C until used.SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli [33] using 12% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R.Enzyme assays were carried out at 30°C in Tris buffer (50 mM, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) in a final volume of 500 µL. Total enzyme concentration was 30 nM for wild-type mAOX1 and 30–200 nM for the variants. Enzyme activity was monitored spectrophotometrically at 600 nm with 100 µM 2,6-dichlorphenolindophenol (DCPIP) as electron acceptor and calculated using the extinction coefficient of 16.1 mM−1 cm−1 for DCPIP [34].To determine retinaldehyde oxidase activity, the assay described by Vila et al. [7] was used with some modifications. Purified mAOX1 (2 µg) was incubated in the dark for 10 min at 30°C in 100 µL of 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 and the reaction was started by the addition of 0.01–10 mM all-trans-retinaldehyde. The reaction was stopped with 100 µL of butanol/methanol (95:5 v/v) containing 0.005% w/v of butylated hydroxytoluene (0.005% w/v) (Sigma-Aldrich). The organic phase was separated and 20 µL were subjected to high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 reverse phase column (4.6×250-mm ODS Hypersil, 5 µm). The production of the oxidation product all-trans-retinoic acid was determined at 340 nm and quantified by using a calibration curves.Purified mAOX1 in 150 µL of 50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, was incubated in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Lab Systems) for 2 h at 4°C before benzaldehyde was added to a final concentration of 300 µM. Complete reduction was achieved by the addition of 20 mM sodium dithionite. Spectra were recorded in 0.15 mL cuvettes using a Shimadzu UV-2401 PC spectrophotometer.The molybdenum and iron contents of the purified proteins were quantified by ICP-OES analysis with a Perkin-Elmer Optima 2100 DV. The samples were wet-ashed at a concentration of 4 µM in a volume of 500 µL by the addition of 500 µM 65% nitric acid and incubated over night at 100°C. The samples were further diluted by the addition of 4 mL of water. As reference, the multi-element standard solution XVI (Merck) was used. The complete Moco content of mAOX1 in comparison to the variants was quantified after conversion to its fluorescent degradation product Form A as described earlier [35].UV/visible CD spectra of 2.1 mg/mL enzyme samples were recorded in 50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5 using a Jasco J-715 CD-spectrophotometer. The scanning mode was set step-wise, each nm a data pitch was recorded, the response time was 2 seconds and each measurement was repeated 4 times.9.5 GHz X-band EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP300E spectrometer equipped with a TE102 microwave cavity. For temperature control between 5 K und 300 K an Oxford ESR 900 helium flow cryostat with an Oxford ITC4 temperature controller was used. The microwave frequency was detected with an EIP frequency counter (Microwave Inc.). Magnetic field was calibrated using a LiLiF standard with a known g-value of 2.002293±0.000002 [36]. Samples (typically 0.1 mM enzyme) were prepared in quartz tubes with 4 mm outer diameter. Chemical reduction, in order to generate the reduced Fe(II)/Fe(III) in the FeS clusters, was performed by adding a small volume of anaerobic sodium dithionite solution to the protein solution under a weak stream of argon gas (20-fold excess dithionite with respect to the protein). The sample tubes were frozen, after a change of colour was observed (typically 30 s reaction time) in liquid nitrogen. Baseline corrections, when required, were performed by subtracting a background spectrum, obtained under the same experimental conditions from a sample containing only a buffer solution. Simulations of the experimental EPR spectra, based on a spin Hamilton operator approach, were performed with the program EasySpin [23]. Second integrals from the simulated spectra of reduced FeSI and FeSII were used to estimate the relative amount of both clusters in the respective samples."

                "\n        The volatile composition of fruit from four Citrus varieties (Powell Navel orange, Clemenules mandarine, and Fortune mandarine and Chandler pummelo) covering four different species has been studied. Over one hundred compounds were profiled after HS-SPME-GC-MS analysis, including 27 esters, 23 aldehydes, 21 alcohols, 13 monoterpene hydrocarbons, 10 ketones, 5 sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, 4 monoterpene cyclic ethers, 4 furans, and 2 aromatic hydrocarbons, which were all confirmed with standards. The differences in the volatile profile among juices of these varieties were essentially quantitative and only a few compounds were found exclusively in a single variety, mainly in Chandler. The volatile profile however was able to differentiate all four varieties and revealed complex interactions between them including the participation in the same biosynthetic pathway. Some compounds (6 esters, 2 ketones, 1 furan and 2 aromatic hydrocarbons) had never been reported earlier in Citrus juices. This volatile profiling platform for Citrus juice by HS-SPME-GC-MS and the interrelationship detected among the volatiles can be used as a roadmap for future breeding or biotechnological applications.\n      "

            "fulltext": "IntroductionDeveloping powerful platforms for volatile analysis is a prerequisite for further insights into the volatiles biosynthetic pathways and also in the identification of the genetic and environmental effects in volatile production [1], [2]. This information is relevant in the frame of current breeding programs in Citrus which are directed to respond to the market demand for quality fruits and are also important for the biotechnology of fruit and fruit derived product. One of the main characteristics of Citrus fruit quality is defined by the aroma of fruit juice. The aroma of a fresh juice is the product of a complex combination of several odour components that include esters, aldehydes, alcohols, ketones and hydrocarbons, which are collectively defined as volatile organic compounds or VOCs [3]–[6]. Headspace extraction coupled to GC-MS is at present the method of choice for most of the volatile analysis in food/flavour chemistry [7], [8] and particularly in Citrus [9]–[17], having displaced former methods that involved complex sample preparation and large amounts of solvents [18]–[20]. Some studies on the compositional analysis of Citrus juice aroma have been described which used dynamic and static headspace extraction [21], [22]. Different types of fibers have been used for Citrus juice analysis by HS-SPME [10], [13], [14], [23] but the one with three components: DVB/CAR/PDMS (divinylbenzene/ carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane) is the most widely used, because of its ability to extract a larger number of VOCs than other fibers [15], [17], [24], [25].\nSo far, almost all the studies on the aroma of Citrus juices had been conducted on orange juice, normally using one or at most two varieties. The fragmented information available together with the different techniques and fibers used, complicates the comparison of VOCs profiles between different Citrus varieties present in the literature [5], [10], [15], [16], [18], [19], [21], [26]–[28]. In contrast to oranges, only few studies have been conducted on mandarin [10], [11] and grapefruit aroma juices [4], [12], [29]. No studies have been performed for the volatiles in the juice of pummelo, and only one comparative study has been reported comparing mandarin and orange juices [3]. In this paper we describe the optimization of a VOCs capture/profiling method for Citrus and the characterization of the volatile profile for the juice of four Citrus varieties: Powell Navel summer orange, Clemenules clementine mandarine, and Fortune mandarine and Chandler pummelo hybrids. All four varieties are used as parentals in order to obtain new hybrids in breeding programs and at the same time they are themselves important varieties for fresh market in the world [30]. This is the first time that different varieties corresponding to different species are analysed in parallel using the same analytical technique and therefore enable us to describe both the volatile fraction in the juice and the variability in the volatile profile between the materials analysed. It is also the first time that the volatiles in the juice of pummelo are described.\nMaterials and Methods\nCitrus juice\nMature fruits at optimal ripening stage [31], were collected in 2007 from trees of Powell Navel Late sweet orange (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb.), Clemenules (Citrus clementine Hort. ex Tan.), and two Citrus hybrids: Fortune (C. clementine x C. tangerine) and Chandler pummelo (C. grandis x C. grandis) varieties. All trees were grown in the same orchard and subjected to homogeneous cultural conditions, in order to reduce environmental effects on the volatile profile. The experimental orchard is located at the Experimental Station of Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias, Moncada, Valencia, Spain, under a mediterranean climate (averages rainfall of 515.8 mm and temperature of 15.2°C for 2007). In all cases, three biological replicate samples for each variety were obtained, each one representing at least four different fruits each. Fruit juice was obtained using a hand extractor, in order to avoid squeezing of the flavedo and to prevent contamination of the juice with peel components. After that, 10 mL aliquots of each sample were placed in 22 mL crimp cap headspace vials and kept frozen at −20°C until analyzed. Two aliquots of 10 mL corresponding to technical replicates of each sample were analyzed. The total number of analysis was 24 (3 biological samples x 2 technical replicates for the 4 varieties).\n\n\nHS-SPME extraction conditions\nRight before analysis, samples were thawed at 20°C for ten minutes and then were subjected to headspace solid phase micro-extraction (HS-SPME). Extraction was carried out using 10 mL of sample into a 22 mL crimp cap headspace vial. A 50/30 µm DVB/CAR/PDMS (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) fiber was used for all the analysis. Pre-incubation and extraction times were 10 and 20 min, respectively. A temperature of 50°C was selected for pre-incubation and extraction because it allowed the detection of a higher number of VOCs than when 30°C was used. Desorption was performed for 1 min at 250°C in splitless mode.\n\n\nGas chromatography–mass spectrometry conditions\nVOCs trapped on the fiber were analysed by GC-MS using an autosampler COMBI PAL CTC Analytics (Zwingen, Switzerland), a 6890N GC Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a 5975B Inert XL MSD Agilent, equipped with an Agilent J&W Scientific DB-5 ms fused silica capillary column (5%-phenyl-95%-dimethylpolysiloxane as stationary phase, 60 m length, 0.25 mm i.d., and 1 µm thickness film). Oven temperature conditions were 40°C for 2 min, 5°C/min ramp until 250°C and then held isothermally at 250°C for 5 min. Helium was used as carrier gas at 1.2 mL/min constant flow. Mass/z detection was obtained by an Agilent mass spectrometer operating in the EI mode (ionization energy, 70 eV; source temperature 230°C). Data acquisition was performed in scanning mode (mass range m/z 35–220; seven scans per second). Chromatograms and spectra were recorded and processed using the Enhanced ChemStation software for GC-MS (Agilent).\n\n\nCompound identification\nCompound identification was based both on the comparison between the MS for each putative compound with those of the NIST 2005 Mass Spectral library and also with the match to our GC retention time and Mass Spectra custom library which have been generated using commercially available compounds. Compounds used as reference were of analytical grade and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Química (Madrid, Spain), except for 2-carene, thymol and ledene, which were obtained from Extrasynthese (Genay, France). In addition to the commercial compounds, seven esters (methyl pentanoate, ethyl pentanoate, methyl heptanoate, ethyl heptanoate, methyl octanoate, methyl nonanoate, and ethyl nonanoate) were synthesized in our laboratory by acid-catalyzed esterification from analytical grade reagents. For that, 10 µL of the corresponding acid (pentanoic acid, heptanoic acid, octanoic acid, or nonanoic acid, supplied by Sigma-Aldrich) was added to 1 mL of the corresponding alcohol (methanol, ethanol) with 10 µL of H2SO4 96%, and incubated at 40°C overnight. After that, a small amount of sodium carbonate was added and incubated at 4°C for 24 hours, to neutralize any remaining acid. The solution was centrifuged and the supernatant used as a ≈1% standard solution of the ester in the respective alcohol. Also, 1 mL of either 100 ppb or of 1 ppm standard solutions was analyzed in the same conditions as the samples. Only those compounds/peaks confirmed by both mass spectrum and retention time in each and every chromatogram were considered. For relative quantification, the peak area was integrated from the extracted ion chromatogram corresponding to a specific ion previously selected for each compound. A mixture of extracts representing the four varieties analysed was injected regularly as part of the injection series and was used as a reference for correction for temporal variation and fiber aging. Finally, corrected results for each compound were expressed as relative ratios to the average level present in Chandler juice. When a compound was not detected in Chandler, the ratio was calculated to a variety that contained it as indicated in Table 1.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 1.  Relative levels (fold changes) of VOCs detected in juices of four Citrus varieties.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0022016.t001\n\nStatistical analysis\nFor both Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis, the complete dataset including all replicates was considered. For both type of analysis, the ratio of the signal relative to that of the average in the four varieties was log 2 transformed. For PCA, the program SIMCA-P version 11 (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) was used with the centered data. For the Hierarchical Cluster Analysis, the program Acuity 4.0 (Axon Instruments) was used, with the distance measures based on the Pearson correlation. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated with the SPSS version 15.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). Data from the correlation matrix was represented as a heatmap by means of the Acuity 4.0 program.\n\nResults and DiscussionTable 1 lists the VOCs detected in our HS-SPME-GC-MS platform and the relative levels for the four varieties analyzed. A total of 109 compounds have been identified: 27 esters (19 aliphatic and 8 monoterpenic acetates), 23 aldehydes (18 aliphatic, 4 monoterpenic and 1 norcarotenoid), 21 alcohols (12 aliphatic and 9 monoterpenic), 13 monoterpene hydrocarbons, 10 ketones (8 aliphatic, 1 norcarotenoid and 1 monoterpenic), 5 sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, 4 monoterpene cyclic ethers, 4 furans and 2 aromatic hydrocarbons. It is important to note that although more than 300 VOCs have been reported in other Citrus juice [26], some of them have been identified only tentatively [16], [18], [19], [24]. To unequivocally assign chemical names to the compounds in our dataset, we have used analytical grade commercial compounds. Those compounds that were putatively identified by their mass spectra but were not confirmed with the commercial standard were not included in our dataset.\nAs a result eleven compounds out of a total of 109 are described here for the first time in the juice of Citrus species (6 esters, 2 ketones, 1 furan and 2 aromatic hydrocarbons) (Table 1); the remaining compounds have been described previously in Citrus juice samples [11], [16], [17], [24], [26], [32]–[34]. Almost all the detected compounds showed dramatic changes in the levels of accumulation in at least one of the four varieties (see Table 1). To better understand the usefulness of the volatile profile to define and distinguish the four Citrus varieties, a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed. Figure 1 shows that the first two principal components explain almost 80% of the variance, and clearly separate all four varieties from one another. The first component, explaining 54% of the variance, mainly separates Chandler pummelo from all the other varieties and to a lesser extent also Powell orange from both Clemenules and Fortune. The second component explains about 25% of the variance and clearly separates Clemenules from Powell and Chandler, while Fortune would be intermediate. Finally, the third component (Figure S1) essentially separates Fortune from the rest, and the analysis of the loading plots should reveal the part of the volatile profile which is characteristic of Fortune, and is responsible of roughly 13% of the total variance. These three components together explain as much as 92% of the total variance in the dataset.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.

The most relevant for the first component is a group of mostly terpenic compounds (β-caryophyllene, (Z)-ocimene, (E,E)-2,4-nonadienal, (Z)- and (E)-linalool oxides, p-cymene) which is almost exclusive of Chandler pummelo, and the compound octyl acetate, a metabolite present at relatively very high levels in Powell. The second component is defined by a group of compounds, mostly esters, with contrasting relative levels between Clemenules and Powell. The most relevant compounds contributing to the separation of Fortune from the other varieties are revealed by the loadings plot corresponding to the third component (Figure S2), and include propyl acetate, citronellyl acetate and ethyl acetate with higher levels in Fortune, and (E)-2-hexen-1-ol, eucalyptol, 3-carene and 1-decanol with lower levels in this variety.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 2.

According to the pattern of VOCs presented by these four varieties, volatile compounds can be organized in three clusters, named A, B and C, with some sub-clusters (named A1, A2, C1, C2 and C3). It is therefore revealed that clusters of VOCs with differential accumulation levels rather than a few individual compounds are responsible for the separation between varieties. For the sake of clarity, compounds in Table 1 are displayed according to the same order than in the hierarchical cluster.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 3.  Hierarchical cluster analysis of both samples and identified volatile compounds.Samples grouped themselves by varieties: Ch, Chandler; Cl, Clemenules; F, Fortune; P, Powell. Volatiles grouped in clusters A, B and C, and sub-clusters A1, A2, C1, C2 and C3.

Colour circles before the name of the compounds describe the chemical family each particular compound belongs to: red, aldehyde; brown, ketone; orange, alcohol; yellow, ester; indigo, furan; pink, aromatic hydrocarbon; light green, monoterpene hydrocarbon; dark green, monoterpene cyclic ether; blue, sesquiterpene.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0022016.g003Correlation analysis of the volatile compounds was also performed, in order to assess how these metabolites were related to each other. When compared to the hierarchical cluster analysis, results are basically consistent. Basically, highly positively correlated volatiles were grouped in the same cluster, and compounds in distant clusters tend to show negative or non-significant correlations (Figure 4, Table S1). When descending to the metabolite to metabolite level, it can be observed a general pattern of high positive correlations of ester compounds to both their alcoholic precursor and other structurally similar esters. This suggests that the levels of these compounds, which show up to 500-fold variations between varieties, could be regulated both by enzymatic activity (by means of relatively specific alcohol acyl transferases) and by substrate availability. A strong negative correlation between ester and aldehyde levels is also observed. This also suggests an important role for alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes activity in the differences detected between the volatile profiles of Chandler, otherwise basically rich in sesquiterpenes and aliphatic aldehydes, and the other varieties with a volatile profile with higher abundance of alcohols and esters.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 4.  Heatmap of the correlation matrix of the volatile compounds.Positive correlations are shown in red; negative correlations in green; absence of correlation in black.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0022016.g004Compounds in the cluster A are present at higher levels in Chandler pummelo than in any of the other three varieties studied. Compounds which are basically exclusive of Chandler belong to sub-cluster A1 and include mostly monoterpene hydrocarbons and derivatives such as 2-carene, (Z)-linalool oxide, (E)-linalool oxide, (Z)-ocimene, p-cymene, and also (E,E)-2,4-nonadienal and nootkatone. Among the compounds in sub-cluster A1, 2-carene had only been identified so far in pummelo peel oil [35] and the sesquiterpene nootkatone has been frequently described in grapefruit juice [4] but rarely in other Citrus juices [18]; the remaining compounds in this subcluster have been identified also in Citrus juices [3], [17], [26]. Sub-cluster A2 includes aliphatic aldehydes from five to nine carbon atoms, and some olefinic aldehydes such as (E)-2-heptenal, (E)-2-octenal, (E)-2-nonenal, and (E,E)-2,4-decadienal, all of which have been described to provide herbal, fruity and floral aroma to Citrus juices [26], [32]. This sub-cluster also includes the compound 2-pentylfuran, reported previously only in tangerine [34], but identified in all four of our varieties in this paper. Cluster A included the only four sesquiterpenes unambiguously identified in our analysis: β-caryophyllene, nootkatone, α-copaene and valencene (β-farnesene was only detected at the level of traces in Powell), all of which had been previously reported in Citrus juices [17], [26]. However, the chromatograms of all varieties, and most notably those of Chandler, presented a large number of unidentified sesquiterpenes (as could be inferred from their MS spectra) which corresponded to the most abundant peaks eluting between 35 and 41 min (Figure S3). The close similarity of the mass spectra of many sesquiterpenes and the lack of standards makes this identification difficult, as it requires the use of purification steps and additional analytical techniques (such as NMR, and chemical synthesis) in order to identify their exact molecular structures. Therefore, although noted here, we did not include them in our approach.\nCluster B is defined by the compounds more abundantly found in Clemenules than in any of the other three varieties. These include a set of highly correlated carotenoid derivatives probably by the action of carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases: β-cyclocitral, β-ionone and geranylacetone (Figure 4, Table S1), and 3-pentanone, a ketone reported here for the first time in a Citrus juice. Other compounds in cluster B have also been previously described in Citrus juice [34] and they include 1-penten-3-one, 2-ethylfuran, 2-methylfuran, eucalyptol and the aldehydes (E)-2-pentenal, decanal, (Z)-3-hexenal, (E)-2-hexenal, and finally β-citronellal, which in our analysis was only detected in Clemenules.\nSub-cluster C1 includes compounds found more abundant in Powell than in the other three varieties. The monoterpene 3-carene and the esters methyl octanoate, methyl decanoate and heptyl acetate are the most important (heptyl acetate is exclusive of Powell variety). Methyl octanoate and methyl decanoate had never been described in Citrus juice, although the presence of many other esters had been previously reported in Citrus [16], [17], [26]. Sub-cluster C2 includes most of the compounds which accumulated generally to higher levels in Fortune than in other varieties, such as linalool or β-citronellol.\nFinally, sub-cluster C3 includes compounds which are present in smaller quantities in Chandler than in the other varieties studied. Included in this sub-cluster are monoterpene hydrocarbons such as α-phellandrene, limonene or γ-terpinene, all of which are generally described in Citrus juices [26]. Also neral and perillaldehyde aldehydes, and 3-methylfuran (the only one of the four furans detected here that had never been described in Citrus juice before) were less abundant in Chandler than in the other three varieties. Some furan compounds are considered to be originated from lipid oxidation [36], but our results suggest independent metabolic pathways for the synthesis of 2- and 3-alkyl furans. This is based in 2-methylfuran showing a very strong positive correlation to 2-ethylfuran and also to 2-pentylfuran in our samples, while no significant correlation was found to 3-methylfuran. Moreover, the majority of compounds included in this sub-cluster showed the highest levels in Powell variety, as it is the case for monoterpenes limonene, α-phellandrene and α-pinene, monoterpene acetates, aliphatic esters octyl-, nonyl-, and decyl acetate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl nonanoate and ethyl decanoate (ethyl nonanoate never been described in Citrus literature before) and the aromatic hydrocarbon styrene. Styrene and pseudocumene (other aromatic hydrocarbon synonymous of 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene) have been identified in all our four varieties for the first time. Of these two, only styrene have been described previously in Citrus commercial juices [21] but not pseudocumene although a compound with a similar structure, 1,4-diethylbenzene, have been reported previously in tangerine juice [37].\nSome volatile compounds commonly described in Citrus juices failed to be detected in our study (Table S2). Thus, no volatile acids were detected in the juices analyzed; in fact it is known that the contribution of the acids to the total aroma of the orange juice is very limited [24]. In addition, some esters usually described in the Citrus juice, such as methyl butanoate [3], [14], [15], [28], ethyl 3-hydroxyhexanoate [5], [16], [28], [33], or methyl o-(methylamino)benzoate [17] were not identified in our samples. Moreover some alcohols such as the aliphatic alcohols 2- and 3-methylbutanol [3] or the monoterpene alcohol borneol and sesquiterpene alcohols β-eudesmol and α-bisabolol [12] described in previous Citrus analysis were not found in our samples. Vanillin was not found in our samples either, although it has been described in many other studies in Citrus juices [5], [27], although this compound usually appears in juices that have undergone degradation due to exposure to high temperature [26]. This is also the case for some aldehydes identified in Citrus aroma, such as cuminaldehyde o (E)-2-undecenal [4], [13], or some C13-norisoprenoids such as β-damascenone or α-ionone identified previously in orange juice [24]. Overall lack of detection of some of those compounds in our samples could be due to these compounds not being present in our samples because of biological/environmental variability, although we cannot discard that differences in extraction and analytical techniques used (i.e. exposure of juices to high temperatures) or misidentification of those compounds in previous reports could be the reason.\nIn summary, over 100 volatile compounds have been unequivocally identified for the first time in the juice of four varieties of Citrus using the same analytical conditions, and therefore allowing us to perform more robust comparisons. Cluster and correlation analyses indicated interesting relationships between compounds and classes of compounds revealing the existence of interesting interactions between the biosynthetic pathways. Our results revealed also that the differences in the volatile profile in Citrus juice are mainly quantitative, and only a few compounds are variety-specific. What appears to be specific is the profile, i.e. relative content of a set of volatiles. Thus, according to the volatile profile, the most different varieties were Chandler and Powell, while Clemenules and Fortune were intermediate and very similar to one another. In Chandler the most characteristic volatiles were principally aliphatic aldehydes, sesquiterpenes such as nootkatone and monoterpenes such as 2-carene. Powell Navel orange showed the highest levels of esters such as nonyl acetate and of monoterpenes such as 3-carene. Clemenules showed the highest levels of ketones 3-pentanone and β-ionone and Fortune showed the highest levels of some acetate esters such as ethyl and propyl acetate, this latter almost Fortune-exclusive.\nVolatile profiling of Citrus juice by HS-SPME-GC-MS has proven therefore to be a highly valuable tool for the characterization of fruit from different varieties. The results and volatile platform described in this paper could be used as a roadmap to guide in the selection process of Citrus breeding programs directed to obtain new varieties with better aroma, to monitor industrial processes that may affect aroma, and also in the study of the pathways leading to volatile production in Citrus.\nFigure S1. \n            Principal Component Analysis score plot (t[1]\n             vs t[3]) for the first and third principal components.\n          doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0022016.s001(TIF)Figure S2.

                "\n        Polymerization of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ), a process which requires that the helical structure of Aβ unfolds beforehand, is suspected to cause neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. According to recent experimental studies, stabilization of the Aβ central helix counteracts Aβ polymerization into toxic assemblies. The effects of two ligands (Dec-DETA and Pep1b), which were designed to bind to and stabilize the Aβ central helix, on unfolding of the Aβ central helix were investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. It was quantitatively demonstrated that the stability of the Aβ central helix is increased by both ligands, and more effectively by Pep1b than by Dec-DETA. In addition, it was shown that Dec-DETA forms parallel conformations with β-strand-like Aβ, whereas Pep1b does not and instead tends to bend unwound Aβ. The molecular dynamics results correlate well with previous experiments for these ligands, which suggest that the simulation method should be useful in predicting the effectiveness of novel ligands in stabilizing the Aβ central helix. Detailed Aβ structural changes upon loss of helicity in the presence of the ligands are also revealed, which gives further insight into which ligand may lead to which path subsequent to unwinding of the Aβ central helix.\n      "

            "fulltext": "IntroductionAlzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders in aging people. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis [1], [2], [3], accumulation of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) in the brain is the primary influence driving AD pathogenesis. Originally insoluble fibrils and plaques composed of Aβ were suspected to cause AD [1], [2], but currently prefibrillar aggregates including soluble oligomers composed of Aβ are also considered to be the cause of AD [3]. Aβ is produced mainly as a 40- or 42-residue peptide by proteolysis of an integral membrane protein, the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data showed that Aβ(1–40) adopts a folded structure including two α-helical regions (residues 15–24 and 29–35) in water/sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles which provide a water-membrane interface mimicking environment [4], [5], and that Aβ(1–42) adopts an unfolded structure including two β-strands (residues 17–21 and 31–36) in aqueous solution [6]. Using NMR it has also been shown that an Aβ(1–42) fibril is a β-sheet composed of two β-strands (residues 18–26 and 31–42) [7]. These structural data indicate that, once Aβ departs from the membrane to the extracellular fluid, its α-helical regions unfold to elongated or β-strand-like forms, and that the β-strands of Aβ enable formation of β-sheets of fibrils and prefibrillar aggregates.\nA wide range of molecules including small compounds and synthetic peptide derivatives have been identified as anti-amyloid agents [8]. Most of these molecules are predicted to bind to elongated or β-strand-like Aβ and to inhibit β-sheet extension, and thus they are expected to prevent Aβ polymerization. However, this strategy may be problematic in that it will favor formation of prefibrillar aggregates such as Aβ oligomers which are cytotoxic [9], and that some of the ligands may act as aggregators [10]. Alternative strategies to develop anti-amyloid agents are needed to overcome these problems. Earlier steps in amyloidogenesis before emergence of β-strand-like Aβ should be targeted to pursue alternative strategies. The emergence of β-strand-like Aβ can be inhibited by trapping Aβ in a state similar to its native structure in membrane embedded APP.\nRecent experimental studies [11], [12] demonstrated that trapping Aβ in a state similar to its native structure by stabilizing the Aβ central helix (residues 15–24) is an effective strategy to reduce Aβ polymerization and Aβ toxicity. Two different classes of ligands were designed to bind and stabilize the Aβ central helix, and it was shown that in the presence of either ligand, Aβ helical content was increased, the amount of Aβ fibrils was reduced, Aβ toxicity to PC12 cells in culture and to hippocampal slice preparations was reduced, and the lifespan of Drosophila model was prolonged [12]. Although many effects of the two ligands (Dec-DETA and Pep1b) are similar, there are also different effects on polymerization. That is, thicker-than-normal Aβ fibrils were detected in the presence of Dec-DETA, and shorter-than-normal Aβ fibrils were detected in the presence of Pep1b, though both ligands substantially reduced the amount of Aβ fibrils. The reason for this was not clarified in the experimental study. We suspect that there are differences in behavior toward Aβ between the two ligands.\nIn order to rationally design new compounds that more effectively stabilize the Aβ central helix and reduce Aβ polymerization into toxic assemblies, detailed molecular mechanisms that underlie unfolding and stabilization of the Aβ central helix should be elucidated. Elucidation of such detailed molecular mechanisms, which are difficult to analyze by using only experimental methods, is possible by taking advantage of computational methods like molecular dynamics (MD). The unfolding process of the Aβ helix has attracted much attention and has been studied by MD simulations [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. However, effects of ligands on the unfolding process of the Aβ helix have not been fully investigated and detailed molecular mechanisms for the Aβ helix stabilization by ligands have not been uncovered yet, though short MD simulations indicated that the designed ligands stabilize the α-helical conformation of Aβ(13–26) [12].\nIn the present study, effects of the two ligands (Dec-DETA and Pep1b) which were designed in the previous experimental study [12] on the unfolding process of the Aβ central helix (residues 15–24) were investigated by MD simulations. The middle region (residues 15–24) of Aβ is of interest, because a short Aβ(16–20) fragment included in this region is capable of binding to full-length Aβ [18], [19] and to the fragment itself [20], [21], in addition, stabilization of this region in an α-helical conformation by mutations or by ligands counteracts Aβ polymerization into toxic assemblies [11], [12]. For the present study, we performed MD simulations for α-helical Aβ(13–26) in the absence or presence of either ligand, since our previous study [17] showed that MD simulations for the short peptide Aβ(13–26) represent the difference between wild-type Aβ and its mutants in good agreement with experimental data. Here we demonstrate that the two ligands are effective in stabilizing the Aβ central helix in agreement with experiments, and thereupon, we compare effects of the two ligands on unwinding of the Aβ central helix. Furthermore, we suggest a possible explanation to why the lower amount of fibrils formed from unwound Aβ monomers incubated with Dec-DETA and with Pep1b are thicker-than-normal and shorter-than-normal, respectively.\nMethods\nPreparation of Systems\nAn initial model structure of Aβ(13–26), whose sequence is HHQKLVFFAEDVGS, was built as an α-helix using the Insight II program (version 2000) [22], because the middle region (residues 15–24) of the full-length Aβ adopts an α-helical conformation surrounded by flexible unstructured regions in a water-membrane interface mimicking environment as shown by experimental studies [4], [5]. Available NMR structures (entry 1BA4 [4] in the Protein Data Bank [23]) of the full-length Aβ have eight or nine backbone O(i)-HN(i+4) hydrogen bonds in the fourteen-residue region (residues 13–26), including six backbone O(i)-HN(i+4) hydrogen bonds in the middle region (residues 15–24). We therefore built the whole peptide (residues 13–26) as an α-helix which has ten backbone O(i)-HN(i+4) hydrogen bonds. Since Aβ(13–26) is a fragment of the full-length Aβ, the N- and C-termini of our model were capped with N-terminal acetyl and C-terminal amide groups, respectively, mimicking the uncharged amide linkage that is adjacent to Aβ(13–26) on both ends in the full-length Aβ.\nStructures of the two ligand-peptide complexes were manually built using the Insight II program to satisfy the ligand-peptide contacts that were intended in their design: The Dec-DETA complex was designed for electrostatic interaction with E22 and D23 via the two basic functional groups and for van der Waals interaction with L17, V18, and A21 via the hydrocarbon tail (Fig. 1); similarly the Pep1b complex was built for electrostatic interaction with E22 and D23 via the two basic functional groups and with H13 and K16 via the two acidic functional groups, and for van der Waals interaction with F20 via the indole group (Fig. 1).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 1.  Initial structures of Aβ and the Aβ-ligand complexes.The initial energy-minimized structures of Aβ (A), the Aβ-Dec-DETA complex (B), and the Aβ-Pep1b complex (C) are shown. The positions of Aβ backbones (ribbons), Aβ sidechains (lines), and the ligands (lines and balls) are displayed. The structural formulae of Dec-DETA (B) and Pep1b (C) are also shown. The numbering of carbon (gray), nitrogen (blue), and oxygen (red) atoms is indicated. The residues of Aβ with which the different groups of the ligands are designed to interact (arrows) are also indicated.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0030510.g001According to an NMR structure (entry 1HZ3 [24] in the Protein Data Bank [23]) of the unfolded Aβ in water at pH 5.7, all the ionizable residues are in their charged states. Besides, in our previous study [17], we showed that similar results were obtained for the Aβ models regardless of the histidine protonation states. Therefore, all the ionizable residues of Aβ(13–26) were prepared in their charged states, where the basic residues (H13, H14, and K16) were protonated at the sidechain N atoms and the acidic residues (E22 and D23) were deprotonated at the sidechain O atoms. All the ionizable functional groups of Dec-DETA and Pep1b were also prepared in their charged states. The total charges of Aβ(13–26), the Aβ(13–26)-Dec-DETA complex, and the Aβ(13–26)-Pep1b complex are +1e, +3e, and +1e, respectively; the systems were neutralized by adding 1, 3, or 1 chloride counterions. Each model was solvated in a rhombic dodecahedron water box filled with TIP3P [25] water molecules with a minimum solute-wall distance of 10 Å. Water molecules with the oxygen atom less than 2.2 Å from any heavy peptide atom were deleted, and 3028, 3021, and 3007 water molecules remained in the Aβ(13–26), Aβ(13–26)-Dec-DETA, and Aβ(13–26)-Pep1b systems, respectively.\n\n\nMD Simulations\nAll calculations were carried out using the CHARMM22/CMAP force field [26], [27], [28] with the CHARMM program [29], [30]. The force field parameters for the ligands (Table S1) were picked from the CHARMM22 force field parameters for proteins, since the ligands were designed basically using amino acid moieties. The SHAKE [31] algorithm was applied to fix all covalent bonds containing a hydrogen atom allowing a 2 fs timestep to be used in the integration of Newton's equations. The nonbonded (van der Waals and Coulomb) interaction energies and forces were smoothly shifted to zero at 12 Å using the atom-based force-shift method [32], [33], and the nonbonded list was constructed with a cutoff of 16 Å and was updated every time any atom moved by more than 2 Å since the last update. Before MD simulations were carried out, structures of the solvated systems were optimized by 500 steps of steepest descent energy minimization with a harmonic restraint of 20 kcal/mol/Å2 on Aβ followed by 1500 steps of adopted basis Newton-Raphson energy minimization without a harmonic restraint on Aβ (Fig. 1). After the systems were heated up to 360 K gradually for 50 ps, ten independent 20 ns MD simulations at 360 K with different initial velocity assignments were carried out for each system to increase sampling [34]. The MD simulations were performed for the optimized systems under periodic boundary conditions at a constant pressure (1 atm) using the Langevin piston method [35] with piston mass 400 amu, collision frequency 20 ps−1 and bath temperature (360 K). The average temperature was checked every 4 ps, and was found to remain within 5 K of the target temperature after the heating MD run. Fast table lookup routines for non-bonded interactions [36] were used to increase speed of the MD simulations. During the MD simulations, no harmonic restraints were imposed on any molecule in the systems, and coordinates were saved every 1 ps.\nIn our previous study [17], we showed that the Aβ central helix completely unfolded at 360 K in 20 ns MD simulations, though it did not unfold at the lower temperatures (300 and 330 K). Therefore, the simulations for each system were performed at 360 K to accelerate dynamics of Aβ. Additionally, one control 20 ns MD simulation for each system was performed at 310 K with the methods used for the MD simulations at 360 K.\n\n\nAnalyses\nAll analyses were carried out for the trajectories obtained by the MD simulations at 360 K, except as otherwise stated. The data of every 10 ps of the trajectories after the heating time of the MD simulations were used for the analyses. Visualization of the structural change of the Aβ and Aβ-ligand complex models during MD simulations was carried out by using the visual molecular dynamics (VMD) software (version 1.8.6) [37].\nTo examine the structural change of Aβ quantitatively, the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and radius of gyration (Rg) were calculated for the middle region (15–24) of Aβ(13–26), thus large fluctuations of the RMSD and Rg due to the mobile N- and C-termini were eliminated. Before the RMSD measurements, overall rotation and translation were removed by least-squares superposition using coordinates of all heavy atoms of the initial energy-minimized Aβ structure obtained prior to the MD simulations. The RMSD was calculated for backbone heavy atoms against the initial energy-minimized coordinates and the Rg was calculated for all atoms along the MD simulation time.\nTo discriminate the type or the pattern of the Aβ structure, the number of α-helical O(i)-HN(i+4) backbone hydrogen bonds (αHBs) in the middle region (15–24) was calculated, using the criterion acceptor-hydrogen distance ≤2.4 Å to define the existence of a hydrogen bond [38].\nTo examine how each ligand interacted with Aβ during the simulations, the probability of the contact between the center of geometry of sidechain heavy atoms of each Aβ residue and each ligand heavy atom was calculated, using the criterion distance ≤6.0 Å. The distance criterion (6.0 Å) was chosen considering the contact distances measured for the initial energy-minimized structures of the Aβ-ligand complexes. A map of the contacts between Aβ and Dec-DETA or Pep1b was created using the calculated probabilities.\nTo determine details of polar interactions between Aβ and each ligand, the number of hydrogen bonds (HBs) between Aβ and Dec-DETA or Pep1b was calculated, using the criterion acceptor-hydrogen distance ≤2.4 Å. For this calculation, both of HBs between Aβ sidechain atoms and ligand atoms and HBs between Aβ backbone atoms and ligand atoms were counted (for each Aβ-ligand complex, the number of the latter HBs was less than 10% of that of all the HBs). When at least one HB between Aβ and the ligand was observed, the ligand was considered to be bound to Aβ.\nAdditionally, to determine details of nonpolar interactions between Aβ and each ligand, the number of C-C and C-N contacts between carbon atoms of the Aβ middle nonpolar part (residues 17–21) and nine heavy atoms of the Dec-DETA hydrocarbon tail (C1–C9) or of the Pep1b indole group (C13–C20 and N3) was calculated, using the criterion C-C or C-N distance ≤5.0 Å. The backbone carbonyl carbon atoms of Aβ were not included in this calculation. The distance criterion (5.0 Å) was chosen considering the radii of carbon (1.8–2.3 Å), nitrogen (1.9 Å), and hydrogen (1.3–1.4 Å) atoms and the C-H and N-H covalent bond lengths (1.0–1.1 Å) used in the CHARMM22 force field [26]. When at least one contact between the Aβ middle nonpolar part and the ligand nonpolar part was observed, the ligand nonpolar part was considered to be in contact with the Aβ middle nonpolar part. In this analysis, contacts between the Aβ middle nonpolar part and the ligand nonpolar parts (the hydrocarbon tail of Dec-DETA and the indole group of Pep1b) were focused on, because it was shown that, during the simulations, the ligand nonpolar parts were mainly in contact with the Aβ middle nonpolar part as they were designed (Fig. 1).\n\nResults\nEffects of the Ligands on Stability of the Aβ Central Helix\nTo examine whether the Aβ central helix eventually unfolded by the end of the simulation, the average backbone RMSD of the Aβ middle region (15–24) and the average number of αHBs of the Aβ middle region calculated for the last 2 ns of the each 20 ns simulation, where fluctuation of the Aβ backbone RMSD is relatively small in every trajectory, were analyzed (Table 1). The trajectories were classified into three groups: group A (RMSD<2.0 Å, 2≤αHB≤6), group B (2.0 Å≤RMSD<4.0 Å, 1≤αHB≤4), and group C (RMSD≥4.0 Å, αHB≈0). By visual inspection, it was ascertained that the Aβ central helix maintained its helical conformation during the whole simulations or refolded after partial unfolding by the end of the simulations in the group A trajectories, that it partially unfolded by the end of the simulations in the group B trajectories, and that it completely unfolded by the end of the simulations in the group C trajectories. The helical Aβ (group A) is observed in only one trajectory in the absence of a ligand, whereas it is observed in five trajectories in the presence of Dec-DETA and is observed in four trajectories in the presence of Pep1b (Table 1). In contrast, the completely unfolded Aβ (group C) is observed in three trajectories in the absence of a ligand, whereas it is observed in only one trajectory in the presence of Dec-DETA and is not observed in any trajectory in the presence of Pep1b (Table 1).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Table 1.  Average RMSD (Å) and average number of αHBs during the last 2 ns of the 20 ns MD simulations calculated for the Aβ middle region in the absence or presence of Dec-DETA or Pep1b.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0030510.t001To examine behavior of the Aβ middle region during the simulations, the backbone RMSD during the whole simulations (Fig. 2A) and during the second half of the simulations (Fig. 2B) was calculated. By analyzing the backbone RMSD of the whole simulation of each trajectory, it was found that the Aβ helix was relatively stable during the first half of the simulations in five out of ten trajectories even if a ligand was not added to the system. For this reason, the second half of the simulations was used for this analysis. By visual inspection, it was determined that Aβ structures with small (RMSD<2.0 Å), medium (2.0 Å≤RMSD<4.0 Å), and large (RMSD≥4.0 Å) RMSD correspond to helical, moderately unwound, and highly unwound or elongated Aβ structures, respectively. Below we refer to these groups as peptide-conformation classes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Both ligands, particularly Pep1b, increase the population of class 1 and decrease the population of class 3 (Fig. 2). During the second half of the simulations, the relative frequencies of class 1 and 3 in the presence of Dec-DETA are 1.6 and 0.5 times the frequencies for Aβ alone. In the presence of Pep1b the corresponding numbers are 2.1 and 0.2. Without a ligand class 3 is more populated than class 1 during the second half of the simulations, a situation which is reversed by both ligands (Fig. 2B).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 2.  Histograms of RMSD of Aβ in the absence or presence of the ligands.The histograms of the Aβ (black bars), Aβ-Dec-DETA (blue bars), and Aβ-Pep1b (green bars) systems are shown. The histograms were obtained using the data of the whole simulations (A) and the second half of the simulations (B) of all ten trajectories of each system. The relative frequencies of the appearance of the Aβ structures sorted out by the three levels of RMSD (RMSD<2.0 Å, 2.0 Å≤RMSD<4.0 Å, and RMSD≥4.0 Å) of the Aβ middle region are indicated. The relative frequencies were calculated against total time of all ten trajectories of each system.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0030510.g002The number of αHBs in the helix was calculated to further characterize the behavior of the Aβ middle region (Fig. 3). The relative frequency of Aβ structures with no αHBs is decreased by addition of both ligands, particularly by addition of Pep1b (Fig. 3). This aspect is observed especially in the second half of the simulations (Fig. 3B). The existence of Aβ structures with five or six αHBs is increased by addition of both ligands, particularly by addition of Pep1b. During the second half of the simulations, the probability to find at least five αHBs is 1.3 and 1.5 times higher for Aβ in the presence of Dec-DETA and Pep1b, respectively, compared to Aβ alone.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 3.

The relative frequencies of the appearance of the Aβ structures sorted out by the number of n αHBs (n = 0−6) of the Aβ middle region are indicated. The relative frequencies were calculated against total time of all ten trajectories of each system.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0030510.g003These results indicate that both addition of Dec-DETA and Pep1b are effective in stabilizing the Aβ central helix and that Pep1b is somewhat more effective than Dec-DETA.\n\n\nInteractions between the Ligands and Aβ\nTo examine whether the ligands were in contact with Aβ as they were designed (Fig. 1), the contact maps (Fig. 4 and 5) were analyzed. All contact probabilities are lower than 0.6, indicating that the ligands sometimes detached from Aβ. By visual inspection of the trajectories, we found both Aβ and the ligands to be quite flexible and that the ligands sometimes detached from Aβ but bound to Aβ again. High contact probabilities (0.4≤P<0.6) are observed for contacts between the basic functional groups (N2 and N3) of Dec-DETA and the acidic residues (E22 and D23) of Aβ and for contacts between the basic functional groups (N5, N7, and N8) of Pep1b and the acidic residues (E22 and D23) of Aβ. Contacts between the acidic functional groups (O1, O2, O4, and O5) of Pep1b and the basic residues (H13 and K16) of Aβ occur with medium probabilities (0.2≤P<0.3). Contacts between the Dec-DETA hydrocarbon tail (C1–C9) and the Aβ middle nonpolar part are distributed from L17 to A21 of Aβ, although the probabilities are low (0.1≤P<0.2). In contrast, contacts between the Pep1b indole group (C13–C20 and N3) and the Aβ middle nonpolar part are localized at F19 and F20 of Aβ, with a preference for F20 (0.2≤P<0.3). Thus, the contact maps show that the ligands were in contact with Aβ as they were designed, even though the ligands sometimes detached from Aβ.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 4.

The Aβ residues and Pep1b atoms corresponding to the X and Y-axis numbers, respectively, are listed below the map.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0030510.g005Contact maps from simulations of both Aβ-ligand complexes at 310 K (Fig. S1 and S2) show higher probabilities (P≥0.6) than at 360 K, and the distribution of contacts in each Aβ-ligand complex is more localized at 310 K than at 360 K. This is because the conformations of Aβ and the ligands did not change so much and the ligands almost always bound to Aβ at 310 K, in contrast to the motions of Aβ and the ligands at 360 K. However, the pattern of contacts in each Aβ-ligand complex at 310 K is similar to that at 360 K, and the main contacts of each Aβ-ligand complex at 310 K are almost the same as those at 360 K. Although motions of the ligands and Aβ are enhanced due to the increased temperature, interactions between the ligands and Aβ at the relatively high temperature are thus similar to those at the body temperature.\nTo understand polar interactions between the ligands and Aβ, the existence of HBs between the ligands and Aβ was analyzed for the three peptide-conformation classes; the frequency of time when the ligands do not form any HBs with Aβ regardless of the peptide conformation was also calculated (Fig. 6A). In total, Dec-DETA and Pep1b form at least one HB with Aβ for 73% and 91% of the total time, respectively (Fig. 6A). When we consider only the helical class 1 conformations, Pep1b is in polar contact (hydrogen bonding contact) with Aβ 1.7 times as often as Dec-DETA (Fig. 6A). The fraction of the occurrence of the polar contacts for each peptide-conformation class (Table 2) shows that Pep1b binds to the Aβ structures in class 1 with higher probability than to the Aβ structures in classes 2 and 3, whereas Dec-DETA binds to all three peptide-conformation classes with similar probabilities. Besides, the fraction of the occurrence of the polar contacts for the class 1 conformations is higher for Pep1b than for Dec-DETA (Table 2). These data indicate that Pep1b binds more specifically to helical Aβ than Dec-DETA does. Additionally, the Aβ structures in class 1 form one more HB on average with Pep1b than with Dec-DETA (Table 3).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 6.

Average number of polar and nonpolar contacts between Aβ and Dec-DETA or Pep1b for each peptide-conformation classa.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0030510.t003In a similar way, we analyzed the existence of nonpolar interactions (C-C and C-N contacts) between the nonpolar groups of the ligands (the hydrocarbon tail of Dec-DETA and the indole group of Pep1b) and the middle nonpolar part (residues 17–21) of Aβ for the three peptide-conformation classes; the frequency of time when the ligands do not have any C-C and C-N contacts with Aβ regardless of the peptide conformation was also calculated (Fig. 6B). In total, the nonpolar groups of Dec-DETA and Pep1b have at least one C-C or C-N contact with the middle nonpolar part of Aβ for 64% and 69% of the total time, respectively (Fig. 6B). When we consider only the class 1 conformations, Pep1b is in nonpolar contact with Aβ 1.4 times as often as Dec-DETA (Fig. 6B). The fraction of the occurrence of the nonpolar contacts for the class 1 conformations is higher for Pep1b than for Dec-DETA (Table 2). These data indicate that the indole group of Pep1b has contacts with the middle nonpolar part of helical Aβ more frequently than the hydrocarbon tail of Dec-DETA does. Additionally, the Aβ structures in class 1 have one more C-C or C-N contact on average with Pep1b than with Dec-DETA (Table 3).\nTo further understand interactions between the ligands and Aβ, we also anlyzed the existence of HBs between the ligands and Aβ for the three peptide-conformation classes in each individual trajectory (Fig. 7). The intermittent lines for the Aβ-Dec-DETA (Fig. 7A) and Aβ-Pep1b (Fig. 7B) complexes show that both ligands sometimes detach from Aβ and bind again to Aβ. Long durations of the ligands in hydrogen bonding contact with the class 1 conformations are more frequent for Aβ-Pep1b (Fig. 7B) than for Aβ-Dec-DETA (Fig. 7A). This shows that, compared to Dec-DETA, Pep1b binds to the helical conformations of Aβ more constantly and is thus more effective in stabilizing the Aβ central helix. In contrast, long durations of the ligands in hydrogen bonding contact with the class 3 conformations are more frequent for Aβ-Dec-DETA than for Aβ-Pep1b, indicating that Dec-DETA binds to the highly unwound or elongated conformations of Aβ for longer periods than Pep1b.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 7.  Timelines of Aβ-ligand contacts.Timelines showing the presence of at least one Aβ-ligand hydrogen bonding contact for Aβ-Dec-DETA (A) and Aβ-Pep1b (B), and for Aβ-Pep1b (C) also when both kinds of HBs between Aβ and Pep1b (between the Aβ acidic residue sidechains and the Pep1b basic functional groups, and between the Aβ basic residue sidechains and the Pep1b acidic functional groups) were formed at the same time. The ligand-binding events are distinguished by using different colors for the three peptide-conformation classes 1 (black bars), 2 (gray bars), and 3 (red bars).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0030510.g007In addition, to examine whether Pep1b binds to Aβ with both acidic and basic functional groups at the same time during the simulation, we analyzed events when both basic and acidic functional groups of Pep1b form HBs with the sidechains of the acidic and basic residues of Aβ, respectively, at the same time (Fig. 7C). All trajectories begin with Aβ in conformation class 1 and Pep1b bound with both acidic and basic groups, and in five trajectories (1, 4, 6, 7, and 8), this is also observed frequently for class 1 during the whole simulation, indicating that Pep1b can bind to helical Aβ with both acidic and basic functional groups at the same time from the beginning to the end of the simulation. In three of these trajectories (1, 4, and 7), Aβ maintained its helical conformation and had not unfolded by the end of the simulation (Table 1, group A).\nAs mentioned above, the group A trajectories exhibit non-unfolding or refolding of Aβ. In one of the group A trajectories of each complex, trajectory 1 of the Aβ-Dec-DETA complex and trajectory 2 of the Aβ-Pep1b complex, Aβ refolded to a helical conformation after being highly unwound during part of the simulations (Fig. 7A and 7B). Dec-DETA was bound to Aβ during the first partial unfolding (8–11 ns) and refolding (11–12 ns) events, and during the first half of the second partial unfolding event (13–16 ns) but not during the second refolding event (16–17 ns) in trajectory Aβ-Dec-DETA-1 (Fig. 7A). Pep1b was bound to Aβ during the partial unfolding event (11–15 ns) except for a short break (12.5–13.5 ns), and was bound to Aβ during the refolding event (15–16 ns) in trajectory Aβ-Pep1b-2 (Fig. 7B). By visual inspection, we found that the charged functional groups of both Dec-DETA and Pep1b formed constant polar contacts with the charged sidechains of Aβ when the ligands were bound to Aβ during the partial unfolding and refolding periods, whereas the nonpolar contacts were intermittent.\nAccording to our previous study [17], the Aβ central helix does not completely unfold in cases where any of the three steps of the three-step mechanism, which was proposed for the complete unfolding of the Aβ central helix, is missing: 1) sufficient loss of α-helical backbone hydrogen bonds, 2) strong interactions between nonpolar sidechains, and 3) strong interactions between polar sidechains. Here we observed that Aβ did not completely unfold due to the lack of steps 3 and 2 in the first and second partial unfolding events, respectively, in trajectory Aβ-Dec-DETA-1, and due to the lack of step 3 in the partial unfolding event in trajectory Aβ-Pep1b-2.\nThese data suggest that strong inter-molecular interactions between the ligand polar groups and the Aβ polar sidechains prevent intra-molecular interactions between the Aβ polar sidechains, thus blocking the third step of the unfolding mechanism in trajectories Aβ-Dec-DETA-1 and Aβ-Pep1b-2. In this way Aβ is inhibited from complete unfolding and instead Aβ refolding is facilitated.\n\n\nLigand-Binding to Unwound Aβ\nAs shown above, both ligands were able to bind to the unwound Aβ structures in the peptide-conformation class 3, and long durations of the ligand-binding for class 3 were more frequent for the Aβ-Dec-DETA complex than for the Aβ-Pep1b complex (Fig. 7). This result suggests that both ligands, particularly Dec-DETA, have the possibility of being involved in the polymerization which occurs after the unfolding of the Aβ central helix. To examine how the ligands interact with unwound Aβ, we analyzed the ligand-binding events for class 3 in each individual trajectory in detail. Details of two Aβ-Dec-DETA trajectories and one Aβ-Pep1b trajectory, which exhibit long durations of the ligand-binding for class 3, are described below. Note that similar features were observed in the other trajectories of each Aβ-ligand simulation.\nIn trajectory 3 of the Aβ-Dec-DETA simulation, Rg of Aβ reaches a peak (Rg≥7.5 Å) at around 17 ns (Fig. 8A), and one or two HBs between Dec-DETA and Aβ are formed at the time (Fig. 8B). At around the time of the Rg peak, β-strand-like forms of Aβ bound by Dec-DETA were observed, and a typical structure of these forms was obtained at 16.96 ns (Fig. 8C). In this structure, two HBs are formed between Aβ and Dec-DETA (Table 4), and the hydrocarbon sidechains of Aβ are located close to the hydrocarbon chain of Dec-DETA (The Cγ1(V18)-C5(Dec-DETA), Cγ1(V18)-C6(Dec-DETA), and Cγ2(V18)-C8(Dec-DETA) distances are 3.97, 3.93, and 4.00 Å, respectively.).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 8.

In this structure, four HBs are formed between Aβ and Dec-DETA (Table 4), and the hydrocarbon sidechains of Aβ are located close to the hydrocarbon chain of Dec-DETA (The Cγ2(V18)-C2(Dec-DETA), Cγ2(V18)-C3(Dec-DETA), and Cβ(A21)-C11(Dec-DETA) distances are 4.00, 4.00, and 4.13 Å, respectively.).\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 9.

The structure obtained at 14.29 ns (with large RMSD (4.59 Å), large Rg (8.48 Å), and four HBs) is also shown (C).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0030510.g009In both Aβ-Dec-DETA structures obtained at the times of the Rg peaks in trajectories 3 and 4, the hydrocarbon chain of Dec-DETA is located along the backbone of β-strand-like Aβ, and thus, β-strand-like Aβ and Dec-DETA form parallel conformations (Fig. 8C and 9C). The parallel conformations of the Aβ-Dec-DETA complex can be formed, due to the non-bulky conformation of Dec-DETA.\nIn trajectory 5 of the Aβ-Pep1b simulation, Rg of Aβ reaches peaks at around 5 and 9 ns (Fig. 10A). The number of HBs between Pep1b and Aβ is more than four at around 5 ns and is less than four at around 9 ns (Fig. 10B). These data show that Pep1b is tightly bound to the highly unwound or elongated Aβ at around the time of the first Rg peak but not at around the time of the second Rg peak. After the first and second Rg peaks, decreases in Rg are observed together with decreases in RMSD (Fig. 10A), and several HBs between Pep1b and Aβ are formed at these times (Fig. 10B), showing that Pep1b is bound to Aβ which adopts compact forms at these times.\n\n            Download:\n            \n                    PPT\n                  \n                  PowerPoint slide\n                \n                    PNG\n                  \n                  larger image\n                  ()\n                \n                    TIFF\n                  \n                  original image\n                  ()\n                Figure 10.

The structures obtained at 5.15 ns (with large RMSD (4.10 Å), large Rg (7.56 Å), and seven HBs), at 6.36 ns (with medium RMSD (3.64 Å), small Rg (6.16 Å), and six HBs), at 9.12 ns (with large RMSD (4.36 Å), large Rg (7.97 Å), and two HBs), and at 10.47 ns (with medium RMSD (3.45 Å), small Rg (6.56 Å), and four HBs) are also shown (C).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0030510.g010β-strand-like forms of Aβ bound by Pep1b were not observed at around the times of both Rg peaks, and instead, bent forms of Aβ bound by Pep1b were observed. Typical structures of these forms observed at around the times of the first and second Rg peaks were obtained at 5.15 and 9.12 ns, respectively (Fig. 10C). After the times of the first and second Rg peaks, compact and partially helical forms of Aβ bound by Pep1b were observed, and typical structures of these forms were obtained at 6.36 and 10.47 ns (Fig. 10C).\nAt the time of the first Rg peak (5.15 ns), seven HBs are formed between Aβ and Pep1b (Table 4), and the H14 imidazole ring of Aβ is located close to the indole ring of Pep1b (The Cδ2(H14)-C15(Pep1b) and Cδ2(H14)-C20(Pep1b) distances are 3.27 and 3.42 Å, respectively.). The backbone of Aβ is bent by the electrostatic interactions and by the auxiliary van der Waals interactions (Fig. 10C). After the time of the first Rg peak (6.36 ns), six HBs are formed between Aβ and Pep1b (Table 4), and the K16 sidechain and the F20 benzene ring of Aβ are located close to the indole ring of Pep1b (The Cγ(K16)-C19(Pep1b) and Cγ(F20)-C19(Pep1b) distances are 3.69 and 3.93 Å, respectively.). The helical form of the backbone of Aβ is partially (Q15-A21) reconstructed by the electrostatic interactions and by the auxiliary van der Waals interactions (Fig. 10C). At the time of the second Rg peak (9.12 ns), two HBs are formed between Aβ and Pep1b (Table 4), and the H13 imidazole ring and the F20 benzene ring of Aβ are located close to the indole ring of Pep1b (The Cδ2(H13)-C16(Pep1b) and Cγ(F20)-C20(Pep1b) distances are 3.63 and 3.66 Å, respectively.). The backbone of Aβ is partially (H13-F20) bent by the van der Waals interactions, though the backbone of Aβ is partially (A21-S26) elongated (Fig. 10C). After the time of the second Rg peak (10.47 ns), four HBs are formed between Aβ and Pep1b (Table 4), and the H13 imidazole ring and the F20 benzene ring of Aβ are located close to the indole ring of Pep1b (The Cγ(H13)-C17(Pep1b) and Cε1(F20)-C20(Pep1b) distances are 3.82 and 3.34 Å, respectively.). The helical form of the backbone of Aβ is partially (Q15-A21) reconstructed by the electrostatic interactions and by the auxiliary van der Waals interactions (Fig. 10C).\nAs shown in the Aβ-Pep1b structures obtained in trajectory 5, the basic and acidic functional groups of Pep1b can simultaneously interact with the sidechains of the acidic and basic residues of Aβ, respectively. In addition, the aromatic ring of Pep1b can at the same time interact with the aromatic rings of Aβ. Aβ therefore cannot easily convert to a β-strand-like form because of these electrostatic and van der Waals interactions. Even if Aβ would be assumed to be a β-strand-like form, parallel conformations of the Aβ-Pep1b complex cannot be formed, due to the bulky conformation of Pep1b.\n\nThe effects of the two ligands (Dec-DETA and Pep1b) on the stability of the Aβ central helix (residues 15–24) were investigated by using MD simulations. Detailed information on structural changes upon loss of helicity in the presence of the ligands was also examined, which might explain the observed difference in structures of Aβ fibrils in the presence of Dec-DETA or Pep1b.As indicated mainly by the Aβ backbone RMSD vs the initial structure and by the existence of αHBs of Aβ, the Aβ central helix completely unfolded by the end of the simulation in three out of ten trajectories in the absence of a ligand, whereas it completely unfolded in only one out of ten trajectories in the presence of Dec-DETA and did not completely unfold in any of ten trajectories in the presence of Pep1b. Compared to Aβ alone, the probability of the Aβ helical state (more than 2/3 of all the αHBs are formed) during the second half of the simulations is 1.3 and 1.5 times higher for Aβ in the presence of Dec-DETA and Pep1b, respectively. It was thus indicated that the stability of the Aβ central helix was increased by both ligands, in agreement with the experimental data [12]. It was also indicated that the ability of Pep1b to stabilize the Aβ central helix is higher than that of Dec-DETA, which was not shown in the previous experimental study [12].The analysis of the ligand-binding events clearly showed that Pep1b binds to the Aβ central helix longer time than Dec-DETA does. A main reason for this is that Pep1b has both basic and acidic functional groups which can simultaneously bind to the acidic and basic residues of Aβ, respectively, whereas Dec-DETA has only the basic functional groups. The inter-molecular interactions between the Aβ polar residues and the ligand polar functional groups are important in stabilizing the Aβ central helix, because they can prevent intra-molecular interactions between the Aβ polar residues that induce complete unfolding of the Aβ central helix [17]. An additional reason would be that Pep1b includes a centrally placed aromatic ring which straddles the Aβ middle nonpolar part (residues 17–21) when the basic and acidic functional groups of Pep1b simultaneously bind to the acidic and basic residues of Aβ, respectively. The inter-molecular interactions between the Aβ middle nonpolar part and the ligand nonpolar part are likely to be important in stabilizing the Aβ central helix, since the Aβ middle nonpolar part includes the three nonpolar residues (VFF) that have low α-helical propensities and high β-strand propensities [39], [40].This analysis also showed that both ligands can bind to highly unwound or elongated forms of Aβ. Dec-DETA was found to be able to form parallel conformations with β-strand-like forms of Aβ. In contrast, Pep1b was found not to be able to form parallel conformations with β-strand-like Aβ, due to the bulky conformation of Pep1b, and instead, Pep1b was found to bend unwound Aβ by the charge-charge interactions and by interactions between the aromatic rings. Therefore, it may be suggested that Dec-DETA could be included upon formation and extension of β-sheets to Aβ fibrils while being sandwiched between the two β-strands (residues 18–26 and 31–42) or being associated with the surface of a β-sheet, thus giving rise to fibrils with an alternative structure. On the other hand, Pep1b bound to unwound Aβ may disturb the extension of β-sheets.To summarize, it appears that Pep1b is somewhat more effective in stabilizing the Aβ central helix than Dec-DETA. In addition, the difference in conformations between the unwound-Aβ complexes bound by Dec-DETA and by Pep1b could be a reason why Aβ incubated with Dec-DETA and with Pep1b form thicker-than-normal and shorter-than-normal fibrils, respectively, as reported by the previous experimental study [12], though the physical and physiological consequence of Dec-DETA containing alternative fibrils in vitro and in vivo is unknown. Hence, our study indicates that, compared to Dec-DETA-like ligands, Pep1b-like ligands, which are capable of having charge-charge interactions with both the acidic and basic residues of the Aβ middle region, additional hydrophobic interactions with the Aβ middle nonpolar part, and bulky conformations, appear to be more effective in inhibiting unwinding of helical Aβ and also in preventing subsequent association of unwound Aβ."
